## About Me

**Lead Researcher in Computer Vision and Image Processing**
With more than 7+ years of experience in computer vision, I have gained extensive expertise through roles in multinational companies across two continents. My academic background includes a PhD and a Master's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Computer Vision, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. My expertise extends to areas such as Machine Learning in Vision, including Object Detection and Video Tracking, as well as IoT, Medical Imaging, and Robotics. I am skilled in designing algorithms for Image Analysis and have a track record of developing robust solutions and writing high-quality code using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Additionally, I have contributed several patents, books, and papers in the field of computer vision.

## Work Experience

### 01.08.2021 - Present (2 years 6 months): Alcon, Teltow, Germany
**Technical Lead, R&D in Image Processing (Medical Devices)**
- Lead the R&D team in software development for medical imaging.
- Focus on real-time data processing, mining, and visualization for ophthalmology tools.
- Develop medical software 
- Handle technical specification and prototype design.
- Key technologies: OpenCV, Python, C++, MATLAB

* I gather information from lots of different camera systems. First, I clean this information and take out the important parts. Then, I label it using special tools I made myself in MATLAB and Python. These tools can also be used by others. After labeling, I check to make sure the labels are correct. Then, I look at the information to find out what it tells us and use what I learn to make our project better. Finally, I write a detailed report about what we did, how we did it, and what we found out. This report helps everyone understand our work better. In my projects, I use MATLAB and Python to make MVPs and check the results. Then I use C++, OpenCV, and Visual Studio to make DLLs for big systems. I also use Git and Azure to help and look at other people's code.
