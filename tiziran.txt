I have been utilizing OpenCV for over 15 years and it is the premier library for computer vision. Other libraries may be useful, but they are not as comprehensive and practical as OpenCV.Question: What types of images does OpenCV support?ChatGPT: OpenCV supports a wide variety of image types, including:Grayscale images: images with only one channel of intensity values, often used for tasks such as edge detection and image thresholding.RGB (Red-Green-Blue) images: images with three channels of color information, often used for tasks such as color-based object detection and image manipulation.Binary images: images with only two intensity values, often used for tasks such as object segmentation and morphological operations.16-bit images: images with 16 bits per channel, often used for tasks such as high dynamic range imaging.32-bit floating point images: images with 32 bits per channel, often used for tasks such as image filtering and image arithmetic operations.It should be noted that OpenCV is a very powerful library and can handle many other image types as well.My thought : Great answer. I have utilized various types of images in OpenCV and it supports a wide range of formats and types. However, I should mention that OpenCV loads color images as BGR.Question: Why and how can we convert an image from Cartesian to polar coordinates using OpenCV?ChatGPT: In image processing, it is sometimes useful to represent an image in polar coordinates instead of the typical Cartesian coordinates. This can be beneficial for certain types of image analysis and manipulation, such as image registration and image enhancement. In OpenCV, the process of converting an image from Cartesian to polar coordinates can be achieved using the cv2.linearPolar() function. This function takes in the image, the center point of the image, the magnitude of the polar transformation, and a flag indicating whether the output image should be inverted. The function then returns the transformed image in polar coordinates.My thought : Great answer. Question: Why do we use meshgrid in OpenCV?ChatGPT: Meshgrid is a utility function in OpenCV that is used to create a rectangular grid out of an array of x and y coordinates. This grid can then be used for various operations, such as transforming and warping images, or for creating masks for filtering or segmentation. Additionally, it can be used for creating the coordinates for a 2D array of pixels in an image, which is useful for various types of image processing tasks.My thought : Okay, that's a good answer. In many projects, I use the meshgrid function and implement floating meshgrid map functions for use in image processing applications where I need to, for example, change the image's Cartesian to polar system.Question: What are some ways to optimize and increase the speed of OpenCV C++ image processing?ChatGPT: There are several ways to optimize and increase the speed of image processing using OpenCV C++:Use the built-in OpenCV functions and avoid using for loops as much as possible, as they can be slow.Use the appropriate data types and data structures for your image processing task.Use the OpenCV parallel_for_ function to parallelize your code and take advantage of multi-core processors.Use the OpenCV's GPU module to perform image processing on the GPU.Avoid unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation by reusing memory where possible.Use OpenCV's performance optimization techniques such as vectorization, unrolling loops, and using lookup tables.Use profilers such as gprof, valgrind, or Visual Studio Profiler to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in your code.Use prebuilt libraries instead of building from source when possible to take advantage of performance optimizations.It's worth noting that, optimizing image processing may require a combination of these approaches, and the best option will depend on the specific task and the requirements of the project.My thought : Okay, that's a good answer. cv::setNumThreads(4); cv::parallel_for_ ; I also compiled OpenCV based on different hardware such as Raspberry pi 3, Raspberry pi 4, Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2, Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit, NVIDIA Jetson Nano ( 2GB and 4GB ram)Question: What are some ways to optimize and increase the speed of OpenCV C++ image

The versioning of different deep learning frameworks are crucial. For example the latest version of OS for Jetson Nano Jetpack which use latest CUDA but the Pytorch only support up to 10.1 now. So we need to install lower Jetpack version on Jetson Nano or compile the Pytorch. I compile Pytorch and it takes few hours with a lot of issue to solve. For the Ubuntu 20 there is not support for CUDA 10 you need install CUDA 11 and compile the Pytorch with a lot of library. install CUDA 10.x on Ubuntu 20 is possible but takes time to solve conflicts also supporting eGPU is another issue for lower ubuntu. On MacOS installing everything is easy because of not supporting GPU but many library and frameworks of the source codes of tracking require GPU version. Even install CPU version of all library does not grantee to run tracking methods. Another aspect is speed. Running tracking even on GPU is very slow based on my experience using Yolo version 3 which is one of the fastest object detection on GTX 2070 can process up to 15 FPS with Full HD videos. Methods on tracking is very different. First generation, it is completely based on computer vision. The second generation combining Kalman filter and advanced computer vision (SIFT), the third generation using deep learning and some of the methods of previous generation like Kalman filter. The fourth generation using combination of two deep learning methods. And the latest generation using complete end to end models like RNN. Object tracking works with all combination of environments such as, moving objects, moving objects and camera in dynamic environments. As long as object appear in the frame until disappeared it the tracking can track and identification as one objects. No mater how many FPS.TrackingClassic object tracking classic feature detection (SIFT and SURF), combined with a machine learning algorithm like KNN or SVM for classification, or with a description matcher like FLANN for object detection.Kalman filtering, sparse and dense optical flow, Example: Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT), which uses a combination of the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter SOT is a hot topic in the last decade. Early visual tracking methods rely on extracting hand-crafted features of candidate target regions, and use matching algorithms or hand-crafted discriminative classifiers to generate tracking results.The MOT track aims to recover the trajectories of objects in video sequences, which is an important problem in computer vision with many applications, such as surveillance, activity analysis, and sport video analysis.Video object detection datasets. The video object detection task aims to detect objects of different categories in video sequences. Multi-object tracking datasetslarge-scale benchmark Multi-Class Multi-object tracking datasetsVisDrone datasets is captured in various unconstrained scenes, focusing on four core problems in computer vision fields, i.e., image object detection, video object detection, single object tracking, and multi- object tracking.the accuracy of detection methods suffers from degenerated object appearances in videos such as motion blur, pose variations, and video de-focus. Exploiting temporal coherence and aggregating features in consecutive frames might to be two effective ways to handle such issue.Temporal coherence. A feasible way to exploit temporal coherence is using object trackersFeature aggregation. Aggregating features in consecutive frames is also a useful way to improve the performance.List of DatasetsMOT20KITTI Tracking MOTChallenge 2015 UA-DETRAC Tracking DukeMTMC Campus MOT17 UAVDT-MOT VisDroneSource codeROLOTensorFlow: linkSiamMaskPyTorch 0.4.1: linkDeep SORTPyTorch ≥ 0.4.0: linkTensorFlow ≥ 1.0: linkTrackR-CNNTensorFlow 1.13.1: linkTracktor++PyTorch 1.3.1: linkJDEPyTorch ≥ 1.2.0: linkMCMOT: One-shot multi-class multi-object trackingSelf collected datasets Video labelingVATICUltimateLabelinghttps://github.com/pirahansiah/UltimateLabeling ReferenceVision Meets Drones: Past, Present and Futurehttps://blog.netcetera.com/object-detection-and-tracking-in-2020-f10fb6ff9af3 https://colab.research.google.com/github/mlvlab/COSE474/blob/master/3_Object_Detection_and_MOT_tutorial.ipynb https://pythonawesome.com/yolo-rcnn-object-detection-and-multi-object-tracking/ https://cv-tricks.com/object-tracking/quick-guide-mdnet-goturn-rolo/ Deep Learning in Video Multi-Object Tracking: A Survey      https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12740 HOTA: A Higher Order Metric for Evaluating Multi-object Tracking https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-020-01375-2 some examples Endeavor to summarize MOT:The best methods running on GPU. The versioning of different deep learning frameworks are crucial. For example the latest version of OS for Jetson Nano "Jetpack" use CUDA 11 but the Pytorch only support up to 10.1 now. So we need to install lower Jetpack version on Jetson Nano or compile the Pytorch. I compile Pytorch and it takes few hours with a lot of issue to solve.

As long as object appear in the frame until disappeared it the tracking can track and identification as one objects. No mater how many FPS.In around 130 videos of the course of Multiple Object Tracking on EDEX means this topic is huge and require more attention for the more research and development.Running MOT on Jetson nano is tricky and hacky in many way. First, the cup is arm based and not many package are build for it.  Datasets for Tracking:MOTChallengeMOT15MOT16/17MOT19KITTIUA-DETRAC tracking benchmarkmetricsMostly Tracked (MT) trajectories: number of ground-truth trajectories that are correctly tracked in at least 80% of the frames.Fragments: trajectory hypotheses which cover at most 80% of a ground truth trajectory. Observe that a true trajectory can be covered by more than one fragment.Mostly Lost (ML) trajectories: number of ground-truth trajectories that are correctly tracked in less than 20% of the frames. False trajectories: predicted trajectories which do not correspond to a real object (i.e. to a ground truth trajectory).ID switches: number of times when the object is correctly tracked, but the associated ID for the object is mistakenly changed.

Use assertions to validate function arguments .Strip undefined behavior from your code, or use assertions to catch illegal uses of undefined behavior .Don't waste people's time. Document unclear assertions .Either remove implicit assumptions, or assert that they are valid .Use assertions to detect impossible conditions.Don't hide bugs when you program defensively.Use a second algorithm to validate your results.Don't wait for bugs to happen; use startup checks.Chapter 3Maintain shipping and debugging versions of your program. Shrink-wrap the shipping version, but use the debugging ver­sion as much as possible to catch bugs quickly.Assertions are a shorthand way to write debugging checks. Use them to catch illegal conditions that should never arise. Don't confuse such conditions with error conditions, which you must handle in the final product.Use assertions to validate function arguments and to alert pro­ grammars when they do something undefined. The more rigidly you define your functions, the easier it will be to validate the arguments.Once you've written a function, review it and  ask  yourself,  'What am I assuming?" If you find an assumption, either assert that your assumption is always valid, or rewrite the code to re­ move the assumption. Also ask, 'What is most likely  to  be  wrong in this code, and how can I automatically detect the prob­lem?" Strive to implement tests that catch bugs at the earliest possible moment. Textbooks encourage programmers to program defensively, but remember that this coding style hides bugs. When you write de­fensive code, use assertions to alert you if the "can't happen" cases do happen.Eliminate random behavior. Force bugs to be reproducible .Destroy your garbage so that it's not misused .Not only did reallocate have to move the block of memory as it was expanding it, but the old memory had to be reallocated and filled with new data. In the assembler, both happened rarely.This brings up another guideline for writing bug-free code: You don't want anything to happen rarely. You need to isolate those behaviors in your subsystems that may happen and make sure that they do happen. And of­ ten. If you find rare behavior in your subsystems, be sure to do something­ anything-to  stir  things up.The assembler bug could have been found within hours, instead of years, if reallocate hadn't so rarely moved blocks when it expanded  them.  If something happens rarely, force it to happen often.Keep debug information to allow stronger error checking.There is no question  that  the debug  code will create  differences  be­ tween the ship and the debug versions of your code, but as long as you're careful not to change the underlying behavior of the code, those differences shouldn't matter. Create thorough subsystem checks, and use them often.Design your tests carefully. Nothing should be arbitrary.Strive to implement transparent integrity checks.Don't apply ship version constraints to the debug version. Trade size and speed for error detection.Chapter 4Don't wait until you have a bug to step through your code.Step through every code path.What About Sweeping Changes? In the past, programmers have asked, "What if I add a feature that touches code in many places? Stepping through all that new code is going to be time consuming." Let me answer that question with another: Can you make such sweeping changes without introducing any bugs? The habit of stepping through your code creates an interesting negative feedback loop. Programmers who step through their code soon learn to write small, easily testable functions because stepping through large func­tions is so painful. Programmers also spend more time thinking about how they can localize the changes they need to make-again, so that they can more easily test their code. And isn't this exactly what you want? No project lead likes it when programmers touch a lot of code; it's too destabilizing. Nor do leads like large, unmanageable functions; they're often unmaintainable. Try hard to localize your changes. If you find that you must make per­vasive changes,  think  twice  before  you  decide  not  to step through  all the new code.Overflow and underflow bugsData conversion bugsOff-by-one bugsNULL pointer bugsBugs using garbage memory (0xA3 bugs)Assignment bugs in which you've used = instead of ==Precedence bugsLogic bugsAs you step through code, focus on data flow. Source level debuggers can hide execution details. Step through critical code at the instruction level .Chapter 5Make it hard to ignore error conditions. Don't bury error codes in return values.Always look for, and eliminate, flaws in your interfaces.Don't write multipurpose functions. Write separate functions to allow stronger argument validation.Don't be wishy-washy. Define explicit function arguments.Write functions that, given valid inputs, cannot fail.Make the code intelligible at the point of call. Avoid  Boolean arguments.Write comments that emphasize potential hazards.Chapter 6Use well-defined data types.Always ask ,"Can this variable or expression  over- or underflow?"Implement your designs as accurately as possible. Being kind a close is being kind a buggy. these principles already: Don't accept special purpose arguments such as the NULL pointer, and Implement your design, not something that approximates it. The third principle is new: Strive to make every function perform its task exactly one time. Implement "the task" just once.Get rid of extraneous if statements.Avoid using nested ?: operators .Handle your special cases just once.Avoid risky language idioms.Don't needlessly mix operator types. If you must mix operators, use parentheses to isolate the operations.Avoid calling functions that return errors.Chapter 7Don't reference memory that you don't own.Don't reference memory that you have freed.Don't use output memory as workspace buffers.Don't  pass data in static (or global) memory.Don't write parasitic functions.Don't abuse your programming language.Tight C does not guarantee efficient machine code.Write code for the "average" programmer.Chapter 8Bugs don't  just "go away."Don't fix bugs later; fix them now.Fix the cause, not the symptom.Don't clean up code unless the clean­ up is critical to the product's success.Don't implement nonstrategic features.There are no free features.Don't allow unnecessary  flexibility.Don't keep "trying"  solutions· until you find one that works. Take the time to find the correct solution.Write and test code in small chunks.Always test your code, even if that means your schedule will slip.Don't rely on the testing group to find your bugs.Don't blame testers for finding your bugs.Establish your priorities and stick to them.Never allow the same bug to bite you twice.A: CODING CHECKLISTSB: MEMORY LOGGING ROUTINESTo sum up Charles Simonyi in the early 1970s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notationchar  ch;byte  b;flag  f;/* flags that are always TRUE or FALSE*/symbol sym;/* some sort of symbol structure*/char byte flag symbol*pch:/* character pointer*/*pb;*pf:*psym:related link: https://www.morling.dev/images/code_review_pyramid.svg Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters Six-week cycles: Our decisions are based on moving the product forward in the next six weeks, not micromanaging time. We don’t count hours or question how individual days are spent. We don’t have daily meetings. We don’t rethink our roadmap every two weeks. Our focus is at a higher level. We say to ourselves: “If this project ships after six weeks, we’ll be really happy. We’ll feel our time was well spent.” Then we commit the six weeks and leave the team alone to get it doneShaping the work: key elements of a solution, appetitepart one shaping:two separate tracks: one for shaping, one for building. Steps to shaping1. Set boundaries.2. Rough out the elements: idea that solves the problem within the appetite but without all the fine details worked out 3. Address risks and rabbit holes. 4. Write the pitch.fixed time, variable scope,Where in the current system does the new thing fit? How do you get to it? What are the key components or interactions? Where does it take you?five ingredients that we always want to include in a pitch:  1. Problem — The raw idea, a use case, or something we’ve seen that motivates us to work on this 2. Appetite — How much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution  3. Solution — The core elements we came up with, presented in a form that’s easy for people to immediately understand  4. Rabbit holes — Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems   5. No-gos — Anything specifically excluded from the concept: functionality or use cases we intentionally aren’t covering to fit the appetite or make the problem tractablepart two : BettingSome companies use two-week cycles (aka “sprints”). We learned that two weeks is too short to get anything meaningful done. Worse than that, two-week cycles are extremely costly due to the planning overhead. The amount of work you get out of two weeks isn’t worth the collective hours around the table to “sprint plan” or the opportunity cost of breaking everyone’s momentum to re-group.after each six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for cool-down. bugs: Use cool-down. Bring it to the betting table.  Schedule a bug smash.We’ve noticed three phases of work when we build a new product from scratch. R&D mode (bet the time on spiking some key pieces of the new product idea.

Do not focus on pricing in this step, as your choice of business model has a far larger influence on profitability than your pricing decisions. Licensing: your royalty rate will generally be equivalent to one-twentieth or less of the revenue per sale; and hence the TAM will as well, because a five percent royalty rate is about the best you can hope for.*16 Set Your Pricing Framework: *17 Calculate the Lifetime Value (LTV) of an Acquired Customer: P 184, 18 Map the Sales Process to Acquire a Customer: P 199, 19 Calculate the Cost of Customer Acquisition (COCA): P 209, 210, 211, 20 Identify Key Assumptions: “Minimum Viable Business Product” (MVBP)—a different concept than the MVP ; 21 Test Key Assumptions: P: 227, 22 Define the Minimum Viable Business Product (MVBP): P: 237, 23 Show That “The Dogs Will Eat the Dog Food”: 24 Develop a Product Plan: you will also need to learn about many other things including the following:• Building a Company Culture• Selecting a Founding Team• Growing and Building the Team (HR Processes)• Developing the Product• Selling and Sales Execution• Servicing the Customer and Building Customer Service Processes• Building Your Financials and Managing Cash Flow• Raising Money to Scale the Business• Entrepreneurial Leadership and Scaling the Business• Building and Utilizing Good Company Governance• And much moreList of books I've read:Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision Second Edition Complete to download the latest draft of Machine Learning Yearning Multiple view geometry in computer vision  Learning OpenCV Book by Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradski  Digital Image Processing, Global Edition by Rafael C.

For example, I write a program to test docker and check the processing time, memory usage, CPU usage, etc. In computer vision application sometime you need to check the output which is the image. How do you want to check it. I write some program to check the output which is the image and compare the ground truth. I check some well known methods such as PSNR, SSIM, Image quality, distortion, brightness, sharpness, etc. Furthermore, I check much different hardware and write some test for computer vision application base on different hardware architecture and Evaluation hardware.Do you want to know your program Automatically adjusting brightness of image in the right way?, How do you know using generic sharpening kernel to remove blurriness is working?, How to do check FPS process?, Which OCR system work better for your input image?https://github.com/pirahansiah/cvtest/blob/main/README.md  Multi-Class Multi-object Video Trackingcomputer vision with deep learning in IoT devicesMulti Camera (Stereo Vision) Calibration for AR/VR headset (extended reality/mixed reality) 3D Image Processing with Deep LearningEnd to End solution for computer vision applications in industry (cloud and IoT)Download all mind map sources https://github.com/tiziran/tiziran.github.io LinkedIn: (around 12K members)Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, GANs, OpenCV, Caffe, TensorFlow,PyTorch  The Computer Vision LinkedIn group: reached to around 8000 members.

Here are several examples of clean code in OpenCV C++:Meaningful variable names:cv::Mat original_image = cv::imread("image.jpg");cv::Mat resized_image;cv::resize(original_image, resized_image, cv::Size(), 0.5, 0.5, cv::INTER_AREA);Use of high-level functions:cv::Mat src = cv::imread("image.jpg");cv::Mat dst;cv::GaussianBlur(src, dst, cv::Size(3,3), 0);Error handling:cv::Mat src = cv::imread("image.jpg");if(src.empty()) {    std::cout << "Error: Could not load image" << std::endl;    return -1;}Use of descriptive function names:cv::Mat srcAppropriate use of OpenCV data structures:cv::Mat src = cv::imread("image.jpg");std::vector<cv::Point2f> corners;cv::goodFeaturesToTrack(src, corners, 100, 0.01, 10);Reusable functions:cv::Mat src = cv::imread("image.jpg");cv::Mat gray;cv::cvtColor(src, gray, cv::COLOR_BGR2GRAY);cv::Mat sharpen_image(const cv::Mat& image) {    cv::Mat result;    cv::GaussianBlur(image, result, cv::Size(0,0), 3);    cv::addWeighted(image, 1.5, result, -0.5, 0, result);    return result;}cv::Mat sharpened = sharpen_image(gray);Clear and concise comments:// Load the source imagecv::Mat src = cv::imread("image.jpg");// Convert the image to grayscalecv::Mat gray;cv::cvtColor(src, gray, cv::COLOR_BGR2GRAY);// Threshold the image to create a binary imagecv::Mat thresholded;cv::threshold(gray, thresholded, 128, 255, cv::THRESH_BINARY);docthis code shows information about imagecode docthis code shows information about imagecode Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuseThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze traffic.

Do you need a deeper understanding of the core ways in which machine learning can improve your business?  Do you want to be able to converse with specialists about anything from regression and classification to deep learning and recommender systems?In this course, you will get hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies.  At the end of the first course you will have studied how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images.  Through hands-on practice with these use cases, you will be able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.This first course treats the machine learning method as a black box.  Using this abstraction, you will focus on understanding tasks of interest, matching these tasks to machine learning tools, and assessing the quality of the output. In subsequent courses, you will delve into the components of this black box by examining models and algorithms.  Together, these pieces form the machine learning pipeline, which you will use in developing intelligent applications.Learning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:   -Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.     -Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.   -Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.     -Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.   -Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models.    -Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.   -Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.   -Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.     -Implement these techniques in Python.All rights and credits are reserved to the respective owner(s).

I check some well known methods such as PSNR, SSIM, Image quality, distortion, brightness, sharpness, etc. Furthermore, I check much different hardware and write some test for computer vision application base on different hardware architecture and Evaluation hardware.Do you want to know your program Automatically adjusting brightness of image in the right way?, How do you know using generic sharpening kernel to remove blurriness is working?, How to do check FPS process?, Which OCR system work better for your input image?https://github.com/pirahansiah/cvtest/blob/main/README.md check S3 bucket in AWS for image and video files and versioning Check Docker load balancer, memory usage, ...GPUVideo Tracking on Maccreate conda based on python 3.6conda create env_full -y --name farshid python=3.6conda activate farshidinstall OpenVino from Intel for converting deep learning model based on intel chipsconda install -y openvino-ie4py -c intelinstall video libraryconda install -y -c conda-forge ffmpeginstall pytorch and torchvision conda install -y pytorch torchvision -c pytorchconda install -y -c conda-forge matplotlibconda install -y pandas scikit-learn plotlyconda install -y -c conda-forge opencv seabornconda install -y -c conda-forge tensorflowpip install torch torchvision torchaudiopip install matplotlib pandas scikit-learn plotly opencv seaborn tensorflowTest for 20213D Multi-Object Tracking: A Baseline and New Evaluation Metrics (IROS 2020, ECCVW 2020) https://github.com/xinshuoweng/AB3DMOT Unsupervised Learning of Probably Symmetric Deformable 3D Objects from Images in the Wild https://github.com/elliottwu/unsup3d This repository contains the public release of the Python implementation of our Aggregate View Object Detection (AVOD) network for 3D object detection. https://github.com/kujason/avod𝚙𝚒𝚙 𝚒𝚗𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚔3𝚍Run on Ubuntu PC + eGPUapt search nvidia-driverapt-cache search nvidia-driversudo apt updatesudo apt upgradesudo apt install nvidia-driver-455sudo reboot nvidia-smiDownload cuDNN v7.6.5 (November 5th, 2019), for CUDA 10.0 tar -xzvf cudnn-10.0-linux-x64-v7.6.5.32.tgz sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda/includesudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7_7.6.5.32-1+cuda10.0_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7-dev_7.6.5.32-1+cuda10.0_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7-doc_7.6.5.32-1+cuda10.0_amd64.deb sudo apt-get install \    apt-transport-https \    ca-certificates \    curl \    gnupg-agent \    software-properties-commoncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88sudo add-apt-repository \   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \   $(lsb_release -cs) \   stable"sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.ioMake sure you have installed the NVIDIA driver and Docker engine for your Linux distribution Note that you do not need to install the CUDA Toolkit on the host system, but the NVIDIA driver needs to be installeddistribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \   && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \   && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.listcurl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/experimental/$distribution/nvidia-container-runtime.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-runtime.listsudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2sudo systemctl restart dockersudo docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smiInstalling on CentOS 8 (AWS)pip install cython;

Clearly we’re missing something big.In 2021, I expect self-supervised methods to learn features of video and images. Could there be a similar revolution in high-dimensional continuous data like video?One critical challenge is dealing with uncertainty. Models like BERT can’t tell if a missing word in a sentence is “cat” or “dog,” but they can produce a probability distribution vector. We don’t have a good model of probability distributions for images or video frames. But recent research is coming so close that we’re likely to find it soon.Suddenly we’ll get really good performance predicting actions in videos with very few training samples, where it wasn’t possible before. That would make the coming year a very exciting time in AI.DeepMind released the code, model, & dataset behind their groundbreaking "AlphaFold" system.

Robot armThere are 4 Courses in this SpecializationCourse1Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning4.8stars801 ratings•205 reviewsReinforcement Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning, but is also a general purpose formalism for automated decision-making and AI. This course introduces you to statistical learning techniques where an agent explicitly takes actions and interacts with the world. Understanding the importance and challenges of learning agents that make decisions is of vital importance today, with more and more companies interested in interactive agents and intelligent decision-making.This course introduces you to the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning. When you finish this course, you will: - Formalize problems as Markov Decision Processes - Understand basic exploration methods and the exploration/exploitation tradeoff - Understand value functions, as a general-purpose tool for optimal decision-making - Know how to implement dynamic programming as an efficient solution approach to an industrial control problem This course teaches you the key concepts of Reinforcement Learning, underlying classic and modern algorithms in RL. After completing this course, you will be able to start using RL for real problems, where you have or can specify the MDP. This is the first course of the Reinforcement Learning Specialization.SHOW ALL ABOUT A COURSE IN THIS SPECIALIZATIONSHOW ALLCourse2Sample-based Learning Methods4.8stars397 ratings•75 reviewsIn this course, you will learn about several algorithms that can learn near optimal policies based on trial and error interaction with the environment---learning from the agent’s own experience. Learning from actual experience is striking because it requires no prior knowledge of the environment’s dynamics, yet can still attain optimal behavior. We will cover intuitively simple but powerful Monte Carlo methods, and temporal difference learning methods including Q-learning. We will wrap up this course investigating how we can get the best of both worlds: algorithms that can combine model-based planning (similar to dynamic programming) and temporal difference updates to radically accelerate learning.By the end of this course you will be able to: - Understand Temporal-Difference learning and Monte Carlo as two strategies for estimating value functions from sampled experience - Understand the importance of exploration, when using sampled experience rather than dynamic programming sweeps within a model - Understand the connections between Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming and TD. - Implement and apply the TD algorithm, for estimating value functions - Implement and apply Expected Sarsa and Q-learning (two TD methods for control) - Understand the difference between on-policy and off-policy control - Understand planning with simulated experience (as opposed to classic planning strategies) - Implement a model-based approach to RL, called Dyna, which uses simulated experience - Conduct an empirical study to see the improvements in sample efficiency when using DynaSHOW ALL ABOUT A COURSE IN THIS SPECIALIZATIONSHOW ALLCourse3Prediction and Control with Function Approximation4.8stars252 ratings•40 reviewsIn this course, you will learn how to solve problems with large, high-dimensional, and potentially infinite state spaces. You will see that estimating value functions can be cast as a supervised learning problem---function approximation---allowing you to build agents that carefully balance generalization and discrimination in order to maximize reward. We will begin this journey by investigating how our policy evaluation or prediction methods like Monte Carlo and TD can be extended to the function approximation setting. You will learn about feature construction techniques for RL, and representation learning via neural networks and backprop. We conclude this course with a deep-dive into policy gradient methods; a way to learn policies directly without learning a value function. In this course you will solve two continuous-state control tasks and investigate the benefits of policy gradient methods in a continuous-action environment.Prerequisites: This course strongly builds on the fundamentals of Courses 1 and 2, and learners should have completed these before starting this course. Learners should also be comfortable with probabilities & expectations, basic linear algebra, basic calculus, Python 3.0 (at least 1 year), and implementing algorithms from pseudocode. By the end of this course, you will be able to: -Understand how to use supervised learning approaches to approximate value functions -Understand objectives for prediction (value estimation) under function approximation -Implement TD with function approximation (state aggregation), on an environment with an infinite state space (continuous state space) -Understand fixed basis and neural network approaches to feature construction -Implement TD with neural network function approximation in a continuous state environment -Understand new difficulties in exploration when moving to function approximation -Contrast discounted problem formulations for control versus an average reward problem formulation -Implement expected Sarsa and Q-learning with function approximation on a continuous state control task -Understand objectives for directly estimating policies (policy gradient objectives) -Implement a policy gradient method (called Actor-Critic) on a discrete state environmentSHOW ALL ABOUT A COURSE IN THIS SPECIALIZATIONSHOW ALLCourse4A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone)4.6stars177 ratings•33 reviewsIn this final course, you will put together your knowledge from Courses 1, 2 and 3 to implement a complete RL solution to a problem. This capstone will let you see how each component---problem formulation, algorithm selection, parameter selection and representation design---fits together into a complete solution, and how to make appropriate choices when deploying RL in the real world. This project will require you to implement both the environment to stimulate your problem, and a control agent with Neural Network function approximation. In addition, you will conduct a scientific study of your learning system to develop your ability to assess the robustness of RL agents. To use RL in the real world, it is critical to (a) appropriately formalize the problem as an MDP, (b) select appropriate algorithms, (c ) identify what choices in your implementation will have large impacts on performance and (d) validate the expected behaviour of your algorithms. This capstone is valuable for anyone who is planning on using RL to solve real problems.To be successful in this course, you will need to have completed Courses 1, 2, and 3 of this Specialization or the equivalent. By the end of this course, you will be able to: Complete an RL solution to a problem, starting from problem formulation, appropriate algorithm selection and implementation and empirical study into the effectiveness of the solution.SHOW ALL ABOUT A COURSE IN THIS SPECIALIZATIONSHOW ALL Using pre trained model to train deeper and lager modelImitation Learning Safety Gym, a suite of environments and tools for measuring progress towards reinforcement learning agents that respect safety constraints while training. It also provides a standardized method of comparing algorithms and how well they avoid costly mistakes while learning. If deep reinforcement learning is applied to the real world, whether in robotics or internet-based tasks, it will be important to have algorithms that are safe even while learning—like a self-driving car that can learn to avoid accidents without actually having to experience them.

In batch reinforcement learning (BRL), models learn by observing many demonstrations by a variety of actors. For instance, a robot might learn how to fix ingrown toenails by watching hundreds of surgeons perform the procedure. But what if one doctor is handier with a scalpel while another excels at suturing? A new method lets models absorb the best skills from each.What’s new: Ajay Mandlekar and collaborators at Nvidia, Stanford, and the University of Toronto devised a BRL technique that enables models to learn different portions of a task from different examples. This way, the model can gain useful information from inconsistent examples. Implicit Reinforcement without Interaction at Scale (IRIS) achieved state-of-the-art BRL performance in three tasks performed in a virtual environment.Key insight: Learning from demonstrations is a double-edged sword. An agent gets to see how to complete a task, but the scope of its action is limited to the most complete demonstration of a given task. IRIS breaks down tasks into sequences of intermediate subgoals. Then it performs the actions required to accomplish each subgoal. In this way, the agent learns from the best parts of each demonstration and combines them to accomplish the task.How it works: IRIS includes a subgoal selection model that predicts intermediate points on the way to accomplishing an assigned task. These subgoals are defined automatically by the algorithm, and may not correspond to parts of a task as humans would describe them. A controller network tries to replicate the optimal sequence of actions leading to a given subgoal.The subgoal selection model is made up of a conditional variational autoencoder that produces a set of possible subgoals and a value function (trained via a BRL version of Q-learning) that predicts which next subgoal will lead to the highest reward.The controller is a recurrent neural network that decides on the actions required to accomplish the current subgoal. It learns to predict how demonstrations tend to unfold, and to imitate short sequences of actions from specific demonstrations.Once it’s trained, the subgoal selection model determines the next subgoal. The controller takes the requisite actions. Then the subgoal selection model evaluates the current state and computes a new subgoal, and so on.Results: In the Robosuite's lifting and pick-and-place tasks, previous state-of-the-art BRL approaches couldn't pick up objects reliably, nor place them elsewhere at all. IRIS learned to pick up objects with over 80 percent success and placed them with 30 percent success.Why it matters: Automatically identifying subgoals has been a holy grail in reinforcement learning, with active research in hierarchical RL and other areas. The method used in this paper applies to relatively simple tasks where things happen in a predictable sequence (such as picking and then placing), but might be a small step in an important direction.We’re thinking: Batch reinforcement learning is useful when a model must be interpretable or safe — after all, a robotic surgeon shouldn’t experiment on living patients — but it hasn’t been terribly effective. IRIS could make it a viable option.   Dec 11, 2019Issue 34   Seeing the World BlindfoldedIn reinforcement learning, if researchers want an agent to have an internal representation of its environment, they’ll build and train a world model that it can refer to. New research shows that world models can emerge from standard training, rather than needing to be built separately.What’s new: Google Brain researchers C. Daniel Freeman, Luke Metz, and David Ha enabled an agent to build a world model by blindfolding it as it learned to accomplish tasks. They call their approach observational dropout.Key insight: Blocking an agent's observations of the world at random moments forces it to generate its own internal representation to fill in the gaps. The agent learns this representation without being instructed to predict how the environment will change in response to its actions.How it works: At every timestep, the agent acts on either its observation (framed in red in the video above) or its prediction of what it wasn’t able to observe (imagery not framed in red). The agent contains a controller that decides on the most rewarding action. To compute the potential reward of a given action, the agent includes an additional deep net trained using the RL algorithm REINFORCE.Observational dropout blocks the agent from observing the environment according to a user-defined probability. When this happens, the agent predicts an observation.If random blindfolding blocks several observations in a row, the agent uses its most recent prediction to generate the next one.This procedure over many iterations produces a sequence of observations and predictions. The agent learns from this sequence, and its ability to predict blocked observations is tantamount to a world model.Results: Observational dropout solved the task known as Cartpole, in which the model must balance a pole upright on a rolling cart, even when its view of the world was blocked 90 percent of the time. In a more complex Car Racing task, in which a model must navigate a car around a track as fast as possible, the model performed almost equally well whether it was allowed to see its surroundings or blindfolded up to 60 percent of the time.Why it matters: Modeling reality is often part art and part science. World models generated by observational dropout aren’t perfect representations, but they’re sufficient for some tasks. This work could lead to simple-but-effective world models of complex environments that are impractical to model completely.We’re thinking: Technology being imperfect, observational dropout is a fact of life, not just a research technique. A self-driving car or auto-piloted airplane reliant on sensors that drop data points could create a catastrophe. This technique could make high-stakes RL models more robust.  Dec 4, 2019Issue 33   Is AI Making Mastery Obsolete?Is there any reason to continue playing games that AI has mastered? Ask the former champions who have been toppled by machines.What happened: In 2016, International Go master Lee Sedol famously lost three out of four matches to DeepMind’s AlphaGo model. The 36-year-old announced his retirement from competition on November 27. “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated,” he told South Korean's Yonhap News Agency,Stages of grief: Prior to the tournament, Lee predicted that he would defeat AlphaGo easily. But the model’s inexplicable — and indefatigable — playing style pushed him into fits of shock and disbelief. Afterward, he apologized for his failure to the South Korean public.Reaching acceptance: Garry Kasparov, the former world-champion chess player, went through his own cycle of grief after being defeated by IBM’s DeepBlue in 1997. Although he didn’t retire, Kasparov did accuse IBM’s engineers of cheating. He later retracted the charge, and in 2017 wrote a book arguing that, if humans can overcome their feelings of being threatened by AI, they can learn from it. The book advocates an augmented intelligence in which humans and machines work together to solve problems.The human element: Although AlphaGo won in the 2016 duel, its human opponent still managed to shine. During the fourth match, Sedol made a move so unconventional it defied AlphaGo’s expectation and led to his sole victory.We’re thinking: Lee wasn't defeated by a machine alone. He was beaten by a machine built by humans under the direction of AlphaGo research lead David Silver. Human mastery is obsolete only if you ignore people like Silver and his team.

You can access to all presentation hereSummary of AI HARDWARE EUROPE SUMMIT (July 2020)Some of the problems FPGAs solve:- excessive heat- electricity consumption- resistance to environmental factors and motion- lifespan  The goal is artificial general intelligence (AGI). AI software and hardware should work together to achieve this goal. A lot of research in this area work with new methods of algorithms and hardware together to achieve high performance. Most of new hardware working with TensorFlow and Pytorch. In most case new hardware come with software solution that have high performance in special use cade or scenario. However, the new hardware can be modify by programmer like Embedded FPGA (eFPGA) in order to implement their requirement. Some of the best presentations are: Machine Intelligent Systems & Software by Victoria Rege from Graphcore, Leveraging sparsity to enable ultra-low latency inferences demonstrated using GrAI One by Orlando Moreira and Remi Poittevin from GrAI Matter Labs, Challenges for Using Machine Learning in Industrial Automation by Ingo Thon from Siemens [Convolutional autoencoder for anomaly detection], From Training to Production Inference for Automotive AI - Transforming Research into Reality ( From laboratory training to automotive inference: the realities of embedding AI) by Tony King-Smith and Marton Feher from AIMotive ,Towards Embedded Intelligence by Michaela Blott from Xilinx, and the last good presentation is MLIR: Accelerating Artificial Intelligence by Albert Cohen from Google. Some key words for the event: FINN is an experimental framework from Xilinx Research Labs to explore deep neural network inference on FPGAs, The MLIR project is a novel approach to building reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure, Fair and useful benchmarks for measuring training and inference performance of ML hardware, software, and services at mlperf.org, Graphcore IPU which is the new type of processor for AI with very high performance.

Algorithm like DRL, AutoML, AGI need higher computing requirements. The challenge on AI chip is tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility, AI algorithms evolve very fast which change the methods of processing,  Idiosyncratic hardware for specific domain, hyper focused on chips not in the system.   I am impress about "Accelerator Benchmarking on Read Edge-inference Applications" presentation at AI HW summit and I like to see live demo of " InferX X1" on October. Do you have any benchmarking of InferX X1 for the deep reinforcement learning? PRESENTATION: Power and Cost Efficient High Performance Inference at the EdgeGeoff Tate - Flex Logix-;  geoff@flex-logix.comAccelerator Benchmarking on Read Edge-inference Applications, He talk about Embedded FPGA (eFPGA) and new product which is "inferX X1" that will come soon. It use TDP:7-13W compare to Nvidia Xavier NX 15W. He mentioned The ResNet-50 with the image size of 224*224 will not tell you the robustness of the memory system that been required with megapixel images. That’s why not good for comparison the best for customer to use and compare is YOLOv3. YOLOv3 intermediate activations are 64MB peak for 2 Megapixel images, this stresses memory subsystems much more than ResNet-50. Their chip is good because of efficiency is in Data packing and transposition. It allowed efficiency 3D convolutions which for each layer ad dedicated path RAM to compute to RAM and deep layer fusion reduces memory requirement and DRAM access in "hidden" in the background.      Embedded FPGA, eFPGA, clustering MACs with a reconfigurable interconnect delivered high inference throughput at low cost, inferX X1 in fab now TDP:7-13W (compare to Nvidia Xavier NX 15W), not Pytorch, the best for customer to use and compare is YOLOv3. YOLOv3 intermediate activations are 64MB peak for 2 Megapixel images, this stresses memory subsystems much more than ResNet-50. They said the normal default image size is 224*224 but the activation intermediate (max layer) growth exponentially by increasing the size of images.     The ResNet-50 with the image size of 224*224 will not tell you the robustness of the memory system that been required with megapixel images. That’s why not good for comparison. Nvidia Xavier NX: has 3 inference (GPU, 2x DLA):self-driving car multiple models are running simultaneously But in most AI system one camera one model one system process images frame per frame. If we have stream of data coming in 15FPS one image at time 15FPS   Key to inferX X1 efficiency is in Data packing and transposition, efficiency 3D convolutions , for each layer ad dedicated path RAM to compute to RAM, deep layer fusion reduces memory requirement, DRAM access in "hidden" in the background, TSMC,GUC,synopsys,arteris,analog bits, cadence, mentor  I am impress about "Machine Intelligent Systems & Software GRAPHCORE IPU" presentation at AI HW summit.

While storage becomes cheaper and smaller, developers find creative ways to increase code size by adding features or unnecessary software engineering. Compilers have come a long way in optimizing applications for code size. While most compiler optimization work were focused on application performance, we have seen increase in the code size optimizations in recent years. This session will cover classical as well as recent compiler optimizations for code size, a few of which Aditya has implemented in the LLVM compiler. Some optimizations (hot cold splitting, function entry instrumentation) require collecting data from the field while the application is running. The presentation will provide an overview of how those compiler techniques help reduce code size. We will also explore some tips and techniques (compiler flags to reduce code size, tuning of compiler options like inline threshold), that help reduce binary size. Having knowledge of the code generated by the compiler and the instruction set architecture can help engineers chose appropriate programming abstractions and idioms.

These parameters can be used to correct for lens distortion, measure the size of an object in world units, or determine the location of the camera in a scene. These tasks are used in applications such as machine vision to detect and measure objects. They are also used in robotics, navigation systems, and 3-D scene reconstruction. Without any knowledge of the calibration of the cameras, it is impossible to do better than projective reconstruction (MathWorks).Non-intrusive scene measurement tasks, such as 3D reconstruction, object inspection, target or self-localization or scene mapping require a calibrated camera model (Orghidan et al. 2011). Camera calibration is the process of approximating the parameters of a pinhole camera model (Tsai 1987; Stein 1995; Heikkila & Silven 1997) of a given photograph or video.There are four main categories of camera calibration methods whereby a number of algorithms have been proposed for each categories/methods, namely knowing object based camera calibration, semi auto calibration, camera self-calibration method, and camera calibration method based on active vision. In computer vision methods, image information from cameras can yield geometric information pertaining to three-dimensional objects. Non-intrusive scene measurement tasks, such as 3D reconstruction, object inspection, target or self-localization, or scene mapping require a calibrated camera model (Orghidan et al. 2011). The correlation between the geographical point and camera image pixel is necessary for camera calibration. Hence, the camera’s parameter, which constitutes the geometric model of camera imaging, are utilized to establish the correlation between the three-dimensional geometric location of one point and a corresponding point in an image (Wang et al. 2010). Typically, experiments are conducted to attain the aforementioned parameters and relevant calculation, which is a process called camera calibration (Hyunjoon et al. 2014; Jianyang et al. 2014; Mohedano et al. 2014; Navarro et al. 2014).Image information from cameras can be used to elucidate the geometric information of a 3D object. The process of estimating the parameters of a pinhole camera model is called camera calibration. The more accurate the estimated parameters, the better the compensation that can be performed for the next stage of the application. In the data collection stage, a camera will take photos of a camera calibration pattern(Tsai 1987; Stein 1995; Heikkila & Silven 1997; Zhengyou 2000). Another angle of the issue is to create a set of pair images from both cameras via high quality images and increased range of slope of calibration pattern. The current methods simply create images upon the detection of calibration pattern. Nonetheless, the consensus in literature is that accurate camera calibration necessitates pure rotation (Zhang et al. 2008) and require sharp images. Recent breakthrough methods, such as Zhang’s (Zhengyou 2000), use fixed threshold to elucidate pixel difference between the frames and pre-setting variables, where slope information for image frame selection in camera calibration phase has been neglected (Audet & Okutomi 2009). Conversely, these approaches become less reliable when image frames are blurred. These problems necessitates that the camera calibration algorithm be enhanced (Wang et al. 2010).OpenCVDeep Learninghttps://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nBRe4lAJJrxdt9XSz9OaUl0GRAnUU2cb2YKJYlxkhZmxPliOZHx-QPAvNYOyJcLrB2hqTbIGpOZ5UvPqx6IJj__RjYiCPc2q8CNmxuEy4emdYsg-zy1CXgeEwRHbfcCHeA=w1280 Engineering of Camera CalibrationOccasionally the out-of-the-box solution does not work, and you need some modified version of the algorithms.The first step of camera calibration is using known pattern images, such as chessboard. However, sometimes the image quality and pattern are not match with standard approach of calibration process.I use some other technique to enhance the result. In the first step, we need to improve the corner detection, and it may be done by fallowing steps. *    The chessboard is used as a pattern of alternating black and white squares,     -    which ensures that there is no bias toward     one side or the other in measurement. *    The image must be an grayscale (single-channel) image.    -    img - Input image.

I wrote many test by myself and I would like to share some of them here. For example, I write a program to test docker and check the processing time, memory usage, CPU usage, etc. In computer vision application sometime you need to check the output which is the image. How do you want to check it. I write some program to check the output which is the image and compare the ground truth. I check some well known methods such as PSNR, SSIM, Image quality, distortion, brightness, sharpness, etc. Furthermore, I check much different hardware and write some test for computer vision application base on different hardware architecture and Evaluation hardware.Do you want to know your program Automatically adjusting brightness of image in the right way?, How do you know using generic sharpening kernel to remove blurriness is working?, How to do check FPS process?, Which OCR system work better for your input image?https://github.com/pirahansiah/cvtest/blob/main/README.md  Multi-Class Multi-object Video Trackingcomputer vision with deep learning in IoT devicesMulti Camera (Stereo Vision) Calibration for AR/VR headset (extended reality/mixed reality) 3D Image Processing with Deep LearningEnd to End solution for computer vision applications in industry (cloud and IoT)Download all mind map sources https://github.com/tiziran/tiziran.github.io LinkedIn: (around 12K members)Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, GANs, OpenCV, Caffe, TensorFlow,PyTorch  The Computer Vision LinkedIn group: reached to around 8000 members.

(می توانید اگر کتاب یا مقاله هست از برنامه های رایگانی که رفرنسها و منابع را مدیریت می کند استفاده کنید و اینجا لینک یا کلید اصل اون منبع را بیاورید)- در انتهای هر روز و یا شروع روز بعد باید تمامی یادداشتهای زودگذر نوشته شده را بررسی کنید. در این قسمت ایده و نظر و فهم خودتان را از یادداشتها می نویسید. هر یادداشت فقط یک ایده یا نظر باید باشد با حداقل جملات (کمتر از یک پاراگراف). به این یادداشتهای اصلی می گویند و برای همیشه می مانند. - طبقه بندی: مهمترین قسمت و اصلی ترین کاری که باید انجام بدهید در این قسمت است. ممکن است خواندن یک مقاله و نوت برداری از آن یک روز طول بکشد و مرتب کردن و ارتباط پیدا کردن یادداشتها هم یک روز طول بکشد و حتی بیشتر از زمانی که برای خواندن می گذارید ولی در نهایت این بخش از کار است که نتیجه اش را در آینده خواهید دید.  - در ابتدا باید بگردید در تمامی عناوین اصلی که دارید و مرتبط ترین را پیدا کنید. مثلا متن شما مربوط به مدیریت دانش شخصی است و یکی از عنوانهایی که در جعبه های یادداشتهایتان دارید مدیریت دانش است پس این متن می تواند به این عنوان مربوط باشد- در مرحله بعدی نقشه محتوا مربوط به آن عنوان را بررسی کنید. ( در جلوتر توضیح می دم که چی هست) و ممکن است چند مرحله نیاز باشد این کار را انجام دهید- در نقشه محتوای آخری که نزدیکترین به این یادداشت هست بگردید و جایگاه مناسب برای قراردادن این نوت را پیدا کنید. سپس آن مجموعه یاداداشتهای مرتبط را بخوانید و نزدیکترین موضوع مرتبط را پیدا کنید.- حالا نوبت به شماره دهی به یادداشتان می رسد. به یادداشت قبلی و بعدی نگان کنید. اگر این یادداشت آخری هست شماره بعد را بنویسید و در جایگاهش بگذارید. مثلا یادداشت قبلی 1234 بوده است و این یادداشت قرار است در انتها قرار بگیرد پس شماره این یادداشت می شود 1235.- اگر این یادداشت بین دوتا یادداشت قرار گرفت شماره گذاری با اضافه کردن حروف صورت می گیرد. مثلا بین 1234 و 1235 می شود 1234a1- حالا شماره این یادداشت و عنوانش ( یا کلمات کلیدی که دارد) را در انتهای نقشه محتوا وارد کنید- به زودی خواهید دید که برای هر موضوعی که مطالات زیادی داشته اید کلی ایده و نظریات و محتوای آماده استفاده داید- در مرحله بعدی به یادداشتهای دائمی می رسیم - بیشتر مربوط به یک موضوع خاص می باشند و قرار است که منتشر بشوند. چند نکته و توضیح - در نرم افزارها به جای چند جعبه که نوتها داخلش باشد از فولدر استفاده می کنیم- یک یادداشت می تواند در چندین موضع مرتبط باشد که می توانیم از هشتگ و لینک استفاده کنیم- ممکن است یک یادداشت در چندین نقشه محتوایی نوشته شده باشد- من نقشه های محتوایی را هم بخش بندی کرده ام و شامل بخشهای خلاصه, مقدمه , تاریخچه , شرح , مقایسه , نتایج , نتیجه گیری - می شود که یادداشتهایی که اضافه می کنم مربوط به همان بخش باشند و بعدا بتوانم به راحتی از آنها استفاده کنم- باید کاری کنید که همه یادداشتها متناوبا بارها مرور و خوانده شوند و اگر یادداشتی بهش مراجعه نشود و مدت زیادی مرور نشود ممکن است بلا استفاده شود- خود نوت برداری شامل چندین مدل است -  Outline Note-Taking Method  - Cornell Note-Taking Method  - Boxing Note-Taking Method  - Charting Note-Taking Method   - Mapping Note-Taking Method  - Sentence Note-Taking Method- انواع طبقه بندی ها برای قسمت یادداشتهای دائمی  - CODE  - Capture: Saving valuable information from the internet and the world around you   - Organize: Breaking that information into small chunks and preparing them for later use   - Distill: Extracting the pieces of knowledge most relevant to your current goals   - Express: Turning your knowledge into creative output that has an impact on others - PARA  - Projects: series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.   - Areas: spheres of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.   - Resources: topics or themes of ongoing interest.   - Archives: inactive items from the other three categories. - productive  - Home  - Goals  - Writings  - Productivity  - Creativity  - Ideas - Zettelkasten  - Fleeting Notes  - Literature Notes  - Permanent Notes / Evergreen  - (MOC (map of content   - Slip-boxمهمترین منبع آموزشی کتاب title: How to take smart notes: One simple technique to boost writing, learning and thinkingauthors: Sönke Ahrensyear: 2022[[@ahrens2022take]]و برنامه رایگانی که ازش استفاده می کنم OBSIDIANبخش اول رفرنسها می باشند. که من از برنامه رایگان JabRef  استفاده می کنم و تمامی رفرنسهایی که ازشون استفاده کرده ام را داخلش می گذارم. این برنامه به خوبی با برنامه های دیگر ترکیب می شود و می تواند به صورت بهینه و اتوماتیک کار رفرنس دهی به متهای شما را انجام بدهد و فرمتهای مخلف را پشتیبانی می کند بعدا برای نوشتن مقاله یا کتاب نیازی به وارد کردن دستی رفرنسها و یا مرتب کردن و عوض کردن فرمت نداریدI use citation plugin 1.  add path to the JabRef database "reading notes/dh.bib"  2.  create folder  "Reading notes"    3.  use Ctrl+Shift+O to select reference     4.  automatically create file based on that reference     5.

Do you need a deeper understanding of the core ways in which machine learning can improve your business?  Do you want to be able to converse with specialists about anything from regression and classification to deep learning and recommender systems?In this course, you will get hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies.  At the end of the first course you will have studied how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images.  Through hands-on practice with these use cases, you will be able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.This first course treats the machine learning method as a black box.  Using this abstraction, you will focus on understanding tasks of interest, matching these tasks to machine learning tools, and assessing the quality of the output. In subsequent courses, you will delve into the components of this black box by examining models and algorithms.  Together, these pieces form the machine learning pipeline, which you will use in developing intelligent applications.Learning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:   -Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.     -Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.   -Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.     -Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.   -Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models.    -Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.   -Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.   -Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.     -Implement these techniques in Python.SHOW ALL ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING FOUNDATIONS: A CASE STUDY APPROACHSHOW ALLCOURSE2Machine Learning: Regression4.8stars5,470 ratings•1,016 reviewsCase Study - Predicting Housing PricesIn our first case study, predicting house prices, you will create models that predict a continuous value (price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).  This is just one of the many places where regression can be applied.  Other applications range from predicting health outcomes in medicine, stock prices in finance, and power usage in high-performance computing, to analyzing which regulators are important for gene expression.In this course, you will explore regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature selection.  You will be able to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity.  You will also analyze the impact of aspects of your data -- such as outliers -- on your selected models and predictions.  To fit these models, you will implement optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.Learning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:   -Describe the input and output of a regression model.   -Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.   -Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.   -Tune parameters with cross validation.   -Analyze the performance of the model.   -Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.   -Deploy methods to select between models.   -Exploit the model to form predictions.    -Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.   -Implement these techniques in Python.SHOW ALL ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING: REGRESSIONSHOW ALLCOURSE3Machine Learning: Classification4.7stars3,662 ratings•603 reviewsCase Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default PredictionIn our case study on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification. In this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We've also included optional content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper! Learning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will be able to:   -Describe the input and output of a classification model.   -Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.   -Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.     -Create a non-linear model using decision trees.   -Improve the performance of any model using boosting.   -Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.   -Describe the underlying decision boundaries.     -Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.     -Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.   -Use techniques for handling missing data.   -Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.   -Implement these techniques in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).SHOW ALL ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING: CLASSIFICATIONSHOW ALLCOURSE4Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval4.7stars2,294 ratings•392 reviewsCase Studies: Finding Similar DocumentsA reader is interested in a specific news article and you want to find similar articles to recommend.  What is the right notion of similarity?  Moreover, what if there are millions of other documents?  Each time you want to a retrieve a new document, do you need to search through all other documents?  How do you group similar documents together?  How do you discover new, emerging topics that the documents cover?   In this third case study, finding similar documents, you will examine similarity-based algorithms for retrieval.  In this course, you will also examine structured representations for describing the documents in the corpus, including clustering and mixed membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).  You will implement expectation maximization (EM) to learn the document clusterings, and see how to scale the methods using MapReduce.Learning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:   -Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors.   -Identify various similarity metrics for text data.   -Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using KD-trees.   -Produce approximate nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.   -Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.   -Cluster documents by topic using k-means.   -Describe how to parallelize k-means using MapReduce.   -Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using mixtures models.   -Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using expectation maximization (EM).   -Perform mixed membership modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).   -Describe the steps of a Gibbs sampler and how to use its output to draw inferences.   -Compare and contrast initialization techniques for non-convex optimization objectives.   -Implement these techniques in Python.SHOW ALL ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING: CLUSTERING & RETRIEVALSHOW ALL Download source code and full text of Mind map from https://github.com/tiziran/tiziran.github.io/tree/main/Machine_Learning_Specialization  Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuseThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze traffic.

In this course, we’ll largely focus on AI at the Edge using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit.First, we’ll start off with pre-trained models available in the OpenVINO™ Open Model Zoo. Even without needing huge amounts of your own data and costly training, you can deploy powerful models already created for many applications.Next, you’ll learn about the Model Optimizer, which can take a model you trained in frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe and more, and create an Intermediate Representation (IR) optimized for inference with OpenVINO™ and Intel® hardware.Third, you’ll learn about the Inference Engine, where the actual inference is performed on the IR model.Lastly, we'll hit some more topics on deploying at the edge, including things like handling input streams, processing model outputs, and the lightweight MQTT architecture used to publish data from your edge models to the web.

For the first, a new lineshould be added before extracting the bounding box points that check whether `box[2]`(e.g. the probability of a given box) is above `args.ct` - assuming you have added `args.ct` as an argument passed to the `draw_boxes` function. If not, the boxshould not be drawn. Without this, any random box will be drawn, which could be a ton ofvery unlikely bounding box detections.========== app.pyimport argparseimport cv2from inference import NetworkINPUT_STREAM = "test_video.mp4"CPU_EXTENSION = "/opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so"def get_args():    '''    Gets the arguments from the command line.

I actually added a function to matchthe different potential colors up to their RGB values first, due to how I took them in from thecommand line:```def convert_color(color_string):    '''    Get the BGR value of the desired bounding box color.    Defaults to Blue if an invalid color is given.    '''    colors = {"BLUE": (255,0,0), "GREEN": (0,255,0), "RED": (0,0,255)}    out_color = colors.get(color_string)    if out_color:        return out_color    else:        return colors['BLUE']```I can also add the tuple returned from this function as an additional `color` argument to feed to`draw_boxes`.Then, the line where the bounding boxes are drawn becomes:```cv2.rectangle(frame, (xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax), color, 1)```I was able to run my app, if I was using the converted TF model from earlier (and placed in the current directory), using the below:```bashpython app.py -m frozen_inference_graph.xml```Or, if I added additional customization with a confidence threshold of 0.6 and blue boxes:```bashpython app.py -m frozen_inference_graph.xml -ct 0.6 -c BLUE```[Note that I placed my customized app actually in `app-custom.py`]Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuseThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze traffic.

Some common revenue streams for accelerators and incubators include:Sponsorship - Many accelerators and incubators are sponsored by corporations, foundations, or government agencies, who provide funding in exchange for branding, marketing, or other benefits.Equity Investment - Some accelerators and incubators do take equity in the startups they support, which allows them to earn a return on their investment if the startup is successful.Program Fees - Some accelerators and incubators charge startups a fee to participate in their programs, which may include access to mentorship, resources, or networking opportunities.Consulting or Advisory Services - Some accelerators and incubators may offer consulting or advisory services to startups for a fee.Event or Conference Revenue - Some accelerators and incubators may host events or conferences, which can generate revenue through ticket sales, sponsorships, or exhibitor fees.grant / loanA grant or a loan can be an attractive option for startups that are looking for funding but do not want to give up equity in their company.A grant is a sum of money that is given to a startup with no obligation to pay it back. Grants are often offered by government agencies, non-profit organizations, or foundations that want to support innovation and entrepreneurship in a particular sector or industry. Grants can be highly competitive, and startups typically have to submit a detailed proposal outlining their business plan, goals, and how they plan to use the funds.A loan, on the other hand, is a sum of money that is borrowed from a lender with the obligation to pay it back over a specified period of time, usually with interest. Loans can be offered by banks, government agencies, or private investors. Startups typically have to submit a detailed business plan and financial projections to qualify for a loan. Loans can be a good option for startups that have a solid plan for revenue generation but need some initial capital to get started.Both grants and loans can provide startups with much-needed funding to help them get off the ground. However, it's important to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any funding agreement before accepting it. Startups should make sure that they understand the repayment terms, interest rates, and any other fees or requirements associated with the grant or loan.sole proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen)Investor Database0. fundraising content 1. alternative datases accelerator/ incubator business angels competitions / conferences investors investor matching / public funding startups2. alternative funding options crowd investments europe family offices europepubluic funding germany3. programs accelerator / incubator DACH-Region Company builder DACH-Region innovation labs DACH-Region4. business angels business angels germany business angels europe carta5.

A major challenge of verifying properties of DNNs with satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers is in handling the networks’ activation functions such as, Reluplex (domain-specific theory solvers; through a lazy approach). 1)devising scalable verification techniques. 2)identifying design choices -> amenable to verification. "Each neuron of a neural network computes a weighted sum of its inputs according to learned weights. It then passes that sum through an activation function to produce the neuron’s final output. Typically, the activation functions introduce nonlinearity to the network, making DNNs capable of learning arbitrarily complex functions, but also making the job of automated verification tools much harder.Driver Assistance Systems and Vision-Based System Validates Driver MonitoringVision-based convolutional neural network system detects phone usage, eating, and drinking. cameras with active infrared lighting; 30 Hz and delivered 8-bit grayscale images at 1280 × 1024-pixel resolution; ResNeXt-34; video-based driver assistance systems, such as automated driving; resilient object detection and tracking; camera: ± 50°field of view (horizontal);  +27°/ -21°field of view (vertical);   > 150 m detection range; 2.6 MP resolution. multi path approach: classifier:  for pattern recognition;  resilient object detection dense optical flow and structure from motion; to detect static objects; 3D structuredeep learning: classify objects, road, edge road, orientation; " Operation principle of the multi purpose camera: During assisted and automated driving, the vehicle must know what is happening in its surroundings at all times. It must reliably detect objects and people, and be able to react to these appropriately. Here, the latest generation of the front video camera from Bosch plays a crucial part: The multi purpose camera for assisted and partially automated driving utilizes an innovative, high-performance system-on-chip (SoC) with a Bosch microprocessor for image-processing algorithms. Its unique multipath approach combines classic image-processing algorithms with artificial-intelligence methods for comprehensive scene interpretation and reliable object detection. With its algorithmic multipath approach and the innovative system-on-chip, this camera generation has been specially developed for high-performance driver assistance systems. In line with this approach, the multi purpose camera uses for example the following technical paths at once for image processing: The first of these is the conventional approach already in use today. Via preprogrammed algorithms, the cameras recognize the typical appearance of object categories such as vehicles, cyclists, or road markings. The second and third paths are new, however. For the second path, the camera uses the optical flow and the structure from motion (SfM) to recognize raised objects along the roadside, such as curbs, central reserves, or safety barriers. The motion of associated pixels is tracked. A three-dimensional structure is then approximated based on the two-dimensional camera image. The third path relies on artificial intelligence. Thanks to machine-learning processes, the camera has learned to classify objects such as cars parked by the side of the road. The latest generation can differentiate between surfaces on the road and those alongside the road via neuronal networks and semantic segmentation. Additional paths are used as required: These include classic line scanning, light detection, and stereo disparity.  " LinkFace recognition/attributes I use citation plugin add path to the JabRef database "reading notes/dh.bib"create folder  "Reading notes"use Ctrl+Shift+O to select reference automatically create file based on that reference Ctrl+Shift+E to insert link to citation page Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuseThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze traffic.

I wrote many test by myself and I would like to share some of them here. For example, I write a program to test docker and check the processing time, memory usage, CPU usage, etc. In computer vision application sometime you need to check the output which is the image. How do you want to check it. I write some program to check the output which is the image and compare the ground truth. I check some well known methods such as PSNR, SSIM, Image quality, distortion, brightness, sharpness, etc. Furthermore, I check much different hardware and write some test for computer vision application base on different hardware architecture and Evaluation hardware.Do you want to know your program Automatically adjusting brightness of image in the right way?, How do you know using generic sharpening kernel to remove blurriness is working?, How to do check FPS process?, Which OCR system work better for your input image?https://github.com/pirahansiah/cvtest/blob/main/README.md  Multi-Class Multi-object Video Trackingcomputer vision with deep learning in IoT devicesMulti Camera (Stereo Vision) Calibration for AR/VR headset (extended reality/mixed reality) 3D Image Processing with Deep LearningEnd to End solution for computer vision applications in industry (cloud and IoT)Download all mind map sources https://github.com/tiziran/tiziran.github.io LinkedIn: (around 12K members)Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, GANs, OpenCV, Caffe, TensorFlow,PyTorch  The Computer Vision LinkedIn group: reached to around 8000 members.

In this video, we're going to explore how computer vision technology can be used to enhance IoT and cloud-based systems, and how it can be used to unlock new possibilities for businesses and consumers alike.Body:* First, let's talk about what computer vision is and how it works. Essentially, computer vision is the technology that enables computers to understand and interpret visual information from the world around us. This can include things like images, videos, and even 3D models.* One of the key ways that computer vision can be used to enhance IoT and cloud-based systems is by enabling devices to better understand and interact with their environment. For example, a computer vision-enabled camera could be used to monitor a manufacturing facility and identify when a machine is in need of maintenance or when an employee is working in an unsafe manner.* Another way that computer vision can be used to enhance IoT and cloud-based systems is by enabling devices to better understand and interact with people. For example, a computer vision-enabled security camera could be used to identify individuals and track their movements, or a computer vision-enabled smart home system could be used to detect when someone is in the room and adjust the lighting or temperature accordingly.* Additionally, computer vision can also be used to enhance cloud-based systems by providing more accurate data and insights. For example, a computer vision-enabled drone could be used to collect data on crops and provide farmers with more accurate information about the health and growth of their crops.Conclusion:* Overall, computer vision technology has the potential to unlock new possibilities for businesses and consumers alike, by enabling IoT and cloud-based systems to better understand and interact with their environment and people. We hope this video has provided you with a better understanding of the potential of computer vision for IoT and cloud, and we look forward to seeing the new possibilities that will be created as this technology continues to evolve.Excited to share my latest project using computer vision and IoT to improve efficiency in manufacturing.

Motion estimation algorithms often use a similarity transform to handle camera translations, rotations, and zooming. The tricky part is getting these algorithms to lock onto the background motion, 0. video frames captured during fast motion are often blurry. Their appearance can be improved either using deblurring techniques (Section 10.3) or stealing sharper pixels from other frames with less motion or better focus (Matsushita, Ofek, Ge et al. 2006). Exercise 8.3 has you implement and test some of these ideas. 1. Background subtraction 2. Motion estimation 3. Motion smoothing 4. Image warping. image warping can result in missing borders around the image, which must be cropped, filled using information from other frames, or hallucinated using inpainting techniques (Section 10.5.1).   Vision stabilization  There is much recent work on  Multi-view 3D reconstruction is a central research topic in computer vision that is driven in many different directions There are many available methods that can handle the noisy image completion problem  In the case of surveillance using a fixed camera, there is no desired motion. In the case of most robotic applications, horizontal and vertical motions are desired, but rotation is not. In some cases of ground vehicles where the terrain is known to have many incline changes, or with aerial vehicles undergoing complicated maneuvers where the vehicle’s body is meant to be in varying orientations, rotation might be desired as the robot is meant to be at an angle at times.  In robotics applications, computational complexity is extremely important due to the need for real-time operation. Also, it is likely that the center of rotation will not lie in the center of the image frame because the camera is rarely mounted at the robot’s center of mass.    This first assumption is made in many video stabilization algorithms, and is a convenient way to seed the correct features with higher trust values. It is not an unreasonable assumption to make. Depending on the application, there is often a large portion of frames where local motion does not occur. In some situations, such as monitoring of steady traffic, there is no guarantee that local motion will not occur. This situation has not been tested, nor has our algorithm been designed to handle it. The second assumption comes from a combination of common sense, and the experience of many computer vision researchers. It makes sense that an object in the scene which does not move will be recognized more easily and more often. Being recognized consistently and consecutively is considered stable. On the other hand, objects which have local motion are less likely to be recognized as often. They might move through shadows, change orientation, or even move completely out of the scene. These possibilities all lead to a less stable class of features. It is likely that, more often than not, there are more background features than foreground features. Moving objects generally cover a small portion of the screen, which usually yields fewer features. Although uncommon, we did not want to make the assumption that this would occur in every frame. Certain scenes will consist of a large portion of local motion, or an object will move very close to the camera, consuming a much larger portion of the scene than the background. As long as some background features are discovered in each frame, our stabilization algorithm should succeed.  image processing tips:the image size and kernel size need to depended. the best way is to use the one variable to define the size of the image and kernel together.the coordinate of the image start at top left of the image/displayin order to change it to the normal coordinate you can usegrid of points; two matrix to X , Y coordinatesubtract half of W, H from X, Y in order to have normal coordinate system for our imagenow we have cartesian coordinate cartesian coordinate to polar coordinateتبدیل فضای کارتزین به پولار در خیلی از برنامه های پردازش تصویر کارایی دارد. برای پیدا کردن ترشلد ها هم می توان استفاده کردin MATLAB we can use ":"for example MatrixA(:) which means all entity of the matrix no mater how many dimensions we have but if we want to implemented in Python we can use numpy.flatten(). in the MATLAB the round is different from python. if you want same result you need implement the rand function by yourself.imge_mask=np.ones_like(image_source)*255imge_mask=imge_mask.astype(np.uint8)imge_mask=imge_mask.flatten() ??? .ravel().asarraynp.logical_and( 1, 2)indexes=[index for index in range(len(array1)) if array1[index] == True]cv2.bitwise_not(yyy)"olive" editor remove silence Questions:How to train model to add new classes?How to add a new class to an existing classifier in deep learning?Adding new Class to One Shot Learning trained modelIs it possible to train a neural network as new classes are given?Merging all several models that detection system for all these tasks.Answer 1:There are several ways to add new classes to the trained model, which require just training for the new classes.Incremental training (GitHub)continuously learn a stream of data (GitHub)online machine learning (GitHub)Transfer Learning TwiceContinual learning approaches (Regularization, Expansion, Rehearsal) (GitHub)Answer 2:Online learning is a term used to refer to a model which takes a continual or sequential stream of input data while training, in contrast to offline learning (also called batch learning), where the model is pre-trained on a static predefined dataset.Continual learning (also called incremental, continuous, lifelong learning) refers to a branch of ML working in an online learning context where models are designed to learn new tasks while maintaining performance on historic tasks. It can be applied to multiple problem paradigms (including Class-incremental learning, where each new task presents new class labels for an ever expanding super-classification problem).Do I need to train my whole model again on all four classes or is there any way I can just train my model on new class?Naively re-training the model on the updated dataset is indeed a solution. Continual learning seeks to address contexts where access to historic data (i.e. the original 3 classes) is not possible, or when retraining on an increasingly large dataset is impractical (for efficiency, space, privacy etc concerns). Multiple such models using different underlying architectures have been proposed, but almost all examples exclusively deal with image classification problems.Answer 3:You could use transfer learning (i.e. use a pre-trained model, then change its last layer to accommodate the new classes, and re-train this slightly modified model, maybe with a lower learning rate) to achieve that, but transfer learning does not necessarily attempt to retain any of the previously acquired information (especially if you don't use very small learning rates, you keep on training and you do not freeze the weights of the convolutional layers), but only to speed up training or when your new dataset is not big enough, by starting from a model that has already learned general features that are supposedly similar to the features needed for your specific task. There is also the related domain adaptation problem.There are more suitable approaches to perform incremental class learning (which is what you are asking for!), which directly address the catastrophic forgetting problem. For instance, you can take a look at this paper Class-incremental Learning via Deep Model Consolidation, which proposes the Deep Model Consolidation (DMC) approach. There are other continual/incremental learning approaches, many of them are described here or in more detail here.Answer 4:by using Continual learning approaches to trained without losing the original classes. It has 3 categories:RegularizationExpansionRehearsalAnswer 5:if you access to the dataset then you can download it and add all you new classes when you have " 'N' COCO Classes + 'M' New classes " after that you can fine tune model based on new dataset. you do not need all of the dataset just same number of image for all class enough. https://learnopencv.com/stanford-mrnet-challenge-classifying-knee-mris/ Before start your machine learning project ask these questions and preparation: What is your inference hardware? specify the use case. specify model interface. how would we monitor performance after deployment? how can we approximate post-deployment monitoring before deployment? build a model and iteratively improve it.

since some false positiveshave colors not compatible with the face (e.g. shadows on jeans) a skin detector isapplied to remove the candidate face regions that do not contain skin pixels;- the second filtering rule is defined on the size of the face: using the depth mapit is quite easy to calculate the size of the candidate face region, which is use-ful to discard smallest and largest faces from the final result set;- the third filtering rule is defined on the depth map to discard flat objects (e.g.candidate faces found in a wall) or uneven objects (e.g. candidate face foundin the leaves of a tree). Combining color and depth data the candidate faceregion can be extracted from the background and measures of depth and reg-ularity are used for filtering out false positives.The size criteria simply remove the candidate faces not included in a fixed rangesize ([12.5,30] cm).

(and a dataset of 230,000 3D facial landmarks)https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07332v3.pdf(a) we construct, for the first time, a very strong baseline by combining a state-of-the-art architecture for landmark localization with a state-of-the-art residual block, train it on a very large yet synthetically expanded 2D facial landmark dataset and fi- nally evaluate it on all other 2D facial landmark datasets. (b) We create a guided by 2D landmarks network which con- verts 2D landmark annotations to 3D and unifies all exist- ing datasets, leading to the creation of LS3D-W, the largest and most challenging 3D facial landmark dataset to date (~230,000 images). (c) Following that, we train a neural network for 3D face alignment and evaluate it on the newly introduced LS3D-W. (d) We further look into the effect of all “traditional” factors affecting face alignment performance like large pose, initialization and resolution, and introduce a “new” one, namely the size of the network. (e) We show that both 2D and 3D face alignment networks achieve per- formance of remarkable accuracy which is probably close to saturating the datasets used. Training and testing code as well as the dataset can be downloaded from https: //www.adrianbulat.com/face-alignment/ 19.Sep.2021Medium https://fi.co/madlibshttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-8382-1389Dreyer's English (learn write English)#book storyGreek Mythology Explained: A Deeper Look at Classical Greek Lore and Myth**Papers:**CALTag: High Precision Fiducial Markers for CameraDiatom Autofocusing in Brightfield Microscopy: a Comparative Study   :implementation variation of the laplacianAnalysis of focus measure operators in shape-from-focus: why laplacian?

The EU regulations will set a new global standard for privacy rights and change the way organizations worldwide store and process personal data. The GDPR brings the importance of preserving the privacy of personal information to the forefront, yet the importance of face images within this context is often overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a solution that helps companies protect face images in IoT devices which record or process image by camera, to strengthen compliance with the GDPR. Our Face is our Identity Our face is the most fundamental and highly visible element of our identity. People recognize us when they see our face or a photo of our face. Recent years have seen exponential increase in the use, storage and dissemination of face images in both private and public sectors - in social networks, corporate databases, IoT, smart-city deployments, digital media, government applications, and nearly every organization’s databases. ---------------------$(aws-okta env stage)aws s3 cp s3://dataset/archive.tar.gz /Users/a.zipaws s3 ls images | tail -n 100aws s3 cp staging-images/test.jpg /Users/test.jpg---------------------screen -rDk get podsDockerRUN chmod +x /tmp/run.shCan run docker in terminal and run code line by linedocker run -it --rm debian:stable-slim bashapt-get updateapt-get installl -y--------------------------------brew install awscli aws-okta kubectx kubernetes-cli tfenvtouch ~/.aws/config--------------------------------------------------------------------docker image rm TETSTDFSAFDSADFdocker image lsdocker system prunedocker run -p 5000:5000 nameDocker:latestdocker build . -t nameDocker:latestdocker container stop number-docker-namedocker container lsdocker pull quay.io/test:v0.0.1docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 -it quay.io/test:v0.0.1curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '[{"fixed":7.4, "a":0, "b":0.56, "c":9.4}]' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdocker run --rm -v /home/.aws/credentials:/root/.aws/credentials -it quay.io/test /bin/sh aws s3 ls --profile=test--------------------------------Cloud software engineer and consultant focusing on building highly available, scalable and fully automated infrastructure environments on top of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure clouds.

I wrote many test by myself and I would like to share some of them here. For example, I write a program to test docker and check the processing time, memory usage, CPU usage, etc. In computer vision application sometime you need to check the output which is the image. How do you want to check it. I write some program to check the output which is the image and compare the ground truth. I check some well known methods such as PSNR, SSIM, Image quality, distortion, brightness, sharpness, etc. Furthermore, I check much different hardware and write some test for computer vision application base on different hardware architecture and Evaluation hardware.Do you want to know your program Automatically adjusting brightness of image in the right way?, How do you know using generic sharpening kernel to remove blurriness is working?, How to do check FPS process?, Which OCR system work better for your input image?https://github.com/pirahansiah/cvtest/blob/main/README.md check S3 bucket in AWS for image and video files and versioning Check Docker load balancer, memory usage, ...GPUIn general I would create a wrapper/adapter that only exposes the needed functionality of such an external dependency. Apart from being able to easer adapt to changes of the external dependency, we can also mock the adapter in our tests and let it do things we could not do so easily with the dependency itself. For our example, we could it have return a predefined image in our test and it is also easier to test if our code behaves properly in presence of failures (that are usually hard to trigger with the real thing.How to convert programming languages: Matlab/Python/C/C++ and modern C++ 231.  trace the images: what happens to each image and memory and copy and transit to that image 1. Using a table and each column transitions for each image  2. always check the call by reference or call by value 3. check the naming similarity    2.  compare the output of each step: store data, matrix, array, and vector to the text file and compare compliantly also compare the differences because in image processing some times not exactly output same and different version of OpenCV also has different result 1. the version of the library  2. the function use which library 3. the input/output of the function and call by reference or call by value    3.  The same function in Matlab, Python, C++, and OpenCV is different even change OS also make difference in output    4. test ... test ... line by lineGoogle SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuseThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze traffic.
