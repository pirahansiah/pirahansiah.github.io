## About me: 
LLMs and Computer Vision Engineering Team Lead
I have 7+ years of experience as an image processing/computer vision/LLM research engineer in 4 multinational companies in two countries, strengthened by my academic background with a Master™s and PhD in Computer Science (Computer Vision). My expertise includes Computer Vision with Machine Learning (Object Detection, Video Tracking), IoT, Medical and Robotics; and I am experienced in designing algorithms for Image Thresholding, Optical Flow, Camera Calibration, and Stereo Vision. Lastly, I have a track record in creating efective metrics, building end-to-end pipelines, and writing production-level codes with OpenCV and Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
