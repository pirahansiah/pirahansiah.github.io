Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vital for businesses, especially startups, as AI's future leans heavily towards inference applications. These models enhance various enterprise applications such as active tracking, intrusion detection, safety monitoring, visual inspection, anomaly detection in manufacturing, quality control, equipment monitoring, facial recognition for security, automated vehicle navigation in warehouses, and gesture recognition for hands-free operation. On-device training with ONNX Runtime enables training models on edge devices like laptops and smartphones without data leaving the device, offering privacy and personalization. LLMs help by analyzing vast datasets to improve algorithms, making model optimization techniques like pruning and quantization more effective. They are crucial in federated learning for training global models without compromising privacy and in developing intuitive interfaces for interacting with models on devices. New large vision models, such as VisionFormer, BEiT-3, and MobileViT II, extend these capabilities further by offering improved accuracy and efficiency in processing and inference tasks. These advancements underscore the importance of LLMs and on-device AI in driving innovation and efficiency in AI applications and infrastructure.
