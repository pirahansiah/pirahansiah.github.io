labeling data
* semi-supervised
    * combining labeled and unlabeled data boosts accuracy
    * getting unlabeled data is cheap
    * label propagation - graph based
* active learning
    * select labeled examples that will best help the model learn
    * sampling techniques
        * margin sampling
        * cluster based sampling
        * query by committee
        * region based sampling
* weak supervision
    * leveraging higher level and/or noisier input from subject matter experts (SMEs)
    * Snorkel
* Data augmentation
    * minor alterations
    * semi supervised data augmentation : UDA, semi-supervised learning with GANs
    * policy based data augmentation: AutoAugment
* Time Series
    * windowing data;
    * human activity recognition (HAR)
        * spectrograms (frequency and time)
        * normalization and encoding
        * multichannel
        * Fourier transform
