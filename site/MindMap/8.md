# ML
**ML Modeling Pipelines in Production**

- Hyperparameter tuning
    - NAS: neural architecture search is a technique for automating the design of artificial neural networks
    - types of parameters in ML models
        - Trainable parameters: learned by the algorithm during training: weights of NN
        - Hyperparameters
            - set before launching learning
            - not updated
            - e.g:learning rate; number of layer
            - Keras autotuner
    - AutoML
