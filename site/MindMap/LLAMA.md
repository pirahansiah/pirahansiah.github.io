Pruning: 
		Reduce redundant parameters 
		not affecting performance by 
		removing connections below a 
		threshold, enhancing model efficiency.

Quantization: 
		Compress and reduce bits for 
		weight representation, constraining 
		weights inside kernels for improved 
		performance and latency reduction.

Ensemble Methods: 
		Train multiple models in 
		parallel (bagging) or sequence (boosting) 
		to minimize errors, enhancing model robustness.

Knowledge Distillation: 
		Transfer knowledge from large 
		models to smaller ones, achieving 
		efficient yet accurate neural networks.

Distributed Machine Learning: 
		Enhance inference by utilizing 
		CPU, GPU, DSP, AI chip 
		processing power together, 
		optimizing performance.

Low Rank Matrix Factorization: 
		Uncover latent structures in data, 
		compressing the representation 
		while preserving important information.

Compact Convolutional Filters: 
		Design special filters for efficiency, 
		replacing over-parametric ones to 
		achieve speedup while maintaining accuracy.

Neural Networks Compression Framework (NNCF): 
		Facilitate efficient model compression 
		and deployment, reducing computational costs.


A mixture of experts (MoE) 
		is a machine learning technique where multiple 
		expert networks (learners) are used to divide 
		a problem space into homogeneous regions. 
		Each expert is specialized in a particular region, 
		and the model uses a routing mechanism to select 
		the appropriate expert for a given input.
