Common solutions for underfitting or overfitting include checking the dataset, conducting error analysis, choosing a different model architecture, and hyperparameter tuning.

## For underfitting (reducing bias):
- Increase model complexity (bigger model)
- Decrease regularization (reduce lambda value)
- Conduct error analysis to understand bias sources
- Try different model architectures
- Tune hyperparameters to find optimal values
- Add more features or construct more complex features
- Increase the number of training epochs
- Use feature selection to include relevant features

## For overfitting (reducing variance):
- Add more training data if possible
- Implement normalization techniques (batch norm, layer norm)
- Use data augmentation to create variations of the training data
- Increase regularization (dropout, L2 regularization, weight decay)
- Conduct error analysis to understand variance sources
- Explore different model architectures
- Tune hyperparameters to balance model complexity
- Apply early stopping to prevent overtraining
- Simplify the model (reduce the number of layers/neurons)
- Perform feature selection to remove irrelevant or noisy features
- Prune the network to remove unnecessary connections or weights
- Use cross-validation to assess the model's performance on unseen data
