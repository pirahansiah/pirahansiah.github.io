SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING ADVERTISEMENT CONTENTS BASED ON FACIAL ANALYSIS WO2020141969A2

In this text delves into his patented innovation that transforms digital advertising by utilizing facial analysis to deliver targeted content. The system captures images of users through an embedded camera in digital signage and employs advanced face detection and analysis modules to extract key facial features such as age range, gender, emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry), styles (e.g., eyeglasses, beard), and attention indicators like gaze direction.

By statistically analyzing these features using trained classification models, the system computes a "weighted image" representing the user's profile. This profile is then matched with a database of weighted advertisements based on predefined matching rules provided by advertisers. The most relevant advertisement is seamlessly displayed on the screen, enhancing user engagement by presenting content tailored to the individual's possible interests‚Äîall without directly collecting personal information.

This innovative approach overcomes the limitations of traditional digital advertising, which often lacks interactivity and personalization. By integrating deep learning technologies and ensuring user privacy, Dr. Pirahansiah's system offers a dynamic and efficient solution that benefits both advertisers and consumers, marking a significant advancement in the field of digital advertising.
