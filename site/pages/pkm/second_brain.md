## "Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential" by Tiago Forte

Organize Folders by Areas of Responsibility: Align with the Second Brain methodology by creating folders within your workspace for each of your major areas of responsibility or interests (e.g., Projects, Health, Learning, etc.).


Create Unique IDs for Each Note: in vscode we can use [[]] in order to create same .md file.
Link Notes: Utilize Markdownâ€™s link functionality to create connections between notes. This reflects the Zettelkasten method encouraged by Forte, enabling a network of thoughts that grow over time.


Implement PARA Method
    Projects: Notes related to current projects with defined objectives and timelines.
    Areas: Notes concerning ongoing areas of interest without specific end dates.
    Resources: Collections of information you might use for multiple projects or areas, like code snippets, templates, or learning materials.
    Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories that you want to keep for historical reference or potential future use.
Automate and Streamline
    Use Tasks in Markdown: Manage tasks within notes by using checkboxes in Markdown. You can track to-do items directly within your notes.
    Automation Scripts: Consider using or writing simple scripts in Python or JavaScript to automate repetitive tasks, like note creation with pre-defined templates or backing up notes.
Regular Review and Maintenance
    Regular Review: Periodically review your notes to update or archive them, ensuring that your digital second brain stays current and useful.
    Refine Your System: Adapt and refine your note-taking system as you discover what works best for your specific needs.
