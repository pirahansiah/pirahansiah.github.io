4-stage process for knowledge management, known as CODE:
Capture: Saving valuable information from the internet and the world around you
Organize: Breaking that information into small chunks and preparing them for later use
Distill: Extracting the pieces of knowledge most relevant to your current goals
Express: Turning your knowledge into creative output that has an impact on others



Personal Knowledge Mastery: PKM is a set of processes, individually constructed, to help each of us make sense of our world, work more effectively, and contribute to society. PKM means taking control of your professional development, and staying connected in the network era, whether you are an employee, self-employed, or between jobs.
 
Personal — according to one’s abilities, interests & motivation. (not directed by external forces)
Knowledge — understanding information and experience in order to act upon it. (know what, know who, know how)
Mastery — the journey from apprentice to disciplined sense-maker and sharer of knowledge. (masters do not need to be managed)

This concept is focused on behavior and habits first, rather than tools, and consists of 4 universal steps called CODE.
 
C (COLLECT)
Your second brain needs a place to collect all the things that resonates with you, from an online article to your grocery list, through reliable tools like to-do list apps, web clipper, note-taking apps, and more.
 
O (ORGANIZE)
Collecting things is easy but then you need to organize and structure them. Tiago uses a system called PARA to organize his content in 4 different categories:
 
Projects: series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.
 
Areas: spheres of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.
 
Resources: topics or themes of ongoing interest.
 
Archives: inactive items from the other three categories.
 
Read more about PARA here.
 
D (DISTILL)
Capturing and saving notes usually leads to large collections of information, but the more notes you keep, the more crucial it is to keep an effective summary of them in order to be able to immediately grasp the meaning of them. Through progressive summarization, you'll be able to get the core of your notes.
 
E (EXPRESS)
Once you've collected and organized all your notes and information, you should consider sharing what you've learned with the world. Otherwise, hoarding information without putting them out there in the world would be pointless.


Projects: series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.
Areas: spheres of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.
Resources: topics or themes of ongoing interest.
Archives: inactive items from the other three categories.
PARA helps to determine the goal of each folder. Here’s what goes within:
