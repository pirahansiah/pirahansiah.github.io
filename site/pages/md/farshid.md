# Computer Vision with LLMs and Multimodal Models

## Comparing Traditional CV, Computer Vision with LLMs, and Multimodal Vision LLMs

### Traditional Computer Vision vs. Computer Vision with LLMs

| **Aspect**                 | **Traditional Computer Vision (CV)**              | **Computer Vision with LLMs**                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Processing**         | Relies heavily on structured inputs like pixel data and predefined features (e.g., edges, textures). | LLMs bring contextual understanding by linking images with semantic information, handling unstructured data like complex scenes. |
| **Task Handling**           | Typically focuses on tasks like object detection, classification, and segmentation, based on predefined models. | LLMs can interpret, reason, and generate descriptions or narratives about images, allowing for richer tasks like visual question answering (VQA) and contextual image captioning. |
| **Feature Engineering**     | Requires manual feature extraction, designing models specific to the task (e.g., SIFT, SURF, HOG for features). | Uses learned representations and embeddings (from models like CLIP) to automatically capture high-level semantic features from visual and textual data. |
| **Model Output**            | Outputs are typically limited to categories, bounding boxes, or pixels. | LLMs can generate more sophisticated outputs, such as complete sentences, descriptions, or answers to visual queries, by leveraging language understanding. |
| **Limitations**             | Struggles with tasks that require complex reasoning, and relies on labeled datasets. | LLMs augment CV by integrating external knowledge, offering explanations, and performing zero-shot or few-shot learning, reducing the need for large, labeled datasets. |
| **Applications**            | Used for tasks like facial recognition, medical imaging, and object tracking. | Can handle more abstract applications like automated image description, human-AI interaction, and content generation, enriching the value of visual data. |
| **Flexibility**             | Limited by task-specific models; different models are needed for different tasks. | LLMs add flexibility by supporting multiple tasks from a single model, allowing for multimodal inputs and outputs. |

### Vision LLMs (Multimodal Models) Comparison

| **Model Type**                | **Vision Models (Traditional CV)**               | **Multimodal Vision LLMs**                                         |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input**                      | Primarily image data (e.g., pixels, frames).      | Multimodal input (image + text), allowing the model to understand both visual and linguistic cues simultaneously. |
| **Output**                     | Categories, bounding boxes, segmentations.       | Richer outputs such as image captions, explanations, reasoning, and cross-modal generation (e.g., text-to-image or image-to-text). |
| **Capabilities**               | Image classification, detection, recognition.    | Can handle complex queries like **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**, cross-modal search (e.g., finding images based on textual description), and contextual explanations. |
| **Example Models**             | ResNet, YOLO, VGG.                               | CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), DALLÂ·E, GPT-4 Vision, Florence. |
| **Learning Style**             | Supervised learning with labeled datasets.       | Multimodal models are often pre-trained on paired image-text data, using techniques like contrastive learning. Some also perform **zero-shot learning**, allowing them to generalize to unseen tasks. |
| **Language-Image Integration** | Limited or none (language is not incorporated).   | LLMs integrate language understanding to enhance image interpretation, contextual retrieval, and richer output generation. |
| **Contextual Understanding**   | Weak; relies on object-level detection and pre-set labels. | Strong; models can understand context within the image (like relationships between objects) and even external knowledge, thanks to LLM integration. |
| **Examples of Use Cases**      | Object recognition in autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical image analysis. | Describing complex scenes, interpreting content in visual media, answering detailed questions about images, and retrieving images based on text queries. |

### Key Benefits of Multimodal Vision LLMs:
1. **Enhanced Reasoning**: By leveraging language models, these systems can not only detect objects but also infer relationships, actions, and high-level meaning in images.
2. **Cross-modal Search and Interaction**: Vision LLMs allow for tasks where text and image are interdependent. For instance, users can search for images using text descriptions, and the system can generate text from images.
3. **Zero-Shot Learning**: Multimodal models like CLIP can understand new categories or tasks without specific training, a capability traditional CV lacks.

### Key Limitations:
1. **Resource Intensive**: These models require vast computational resources and extensive datasets to train and fine-tune, making them expensive to deploy at scale.
2. **Complexity**: Integrating vision and language requires sophisticated architectures and training techniques, making development and maintenance more challenging than traditional CV.

- **Use Case**: Smart city systems where after detecting a car, additional data like emissions status or registration info can be fetched.

{ 
def get_car_details(car_image):  
    detected_car = detect_object(car_image)  
    car_details = call_external_api(detected_car)  
    return car_details  
}

### 7. **Superposition Prompting**

#### Traditional CV:
- **Example**: Not applicable in traditional CV systems.

#### CV with LLMs:
- **Example**: Superposition prompting allows the LLM to decide between multiple subtasks. For example, deciding whether to describe an image or perform object detection.
- **Use Case**: Smart assistants, where the LLM decides how to respond based on user interaction.

{ 
def superposition_prompting_example(image_input):  
    possible_tasks = ["describe", "detect_objects"]  
    selected_task = llm_select_task(possible_tasks, image_input)  
    return selected_task  
}

}

#### Multimodal Vision LLMs:
- **Example**: Handling multiple prompts at once to generate both image captions and visual reasoning answers.
- **Use Case**: Interactive educational systems that provide a detailed description and answer follow-up questions about visual data.

{ 
def multimodal_superposition_prompt(image_input):  
    task_options = ["caption", "vqa"]  
    results = handle_superposition_prompts(task_options, image_input)  
    return results  
}

### 8. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Computer Vision**

#### Traditional CV:
- **Example**: Not applicable.

#### CV with LLMs:
- **Example**: Using RAG to retrieve external data that enhances the visual understanding of a detected object.
- **Use Case**: Real estate systems where LLMs retrieve property history after recognizing a building.

{ 
def rag_in_cv(image):  
    detected_building = detect_building(image)  
    property_data = retrieve_external_data(detected_building)  
    return property_data  
}

}

#### Multimodal Vision LLMs:
- **Example**: Retrieving both visual and textual data to enhance image understanding. For example, retrieving relevant articles or images about detected objects.
- **Use Case**: News media platforms that retrieve articles and images related to visual news content.

{ 
def multimodal_rag(image_input):  
    detected_subject = detect_image_subject(image_input)  
    retrieved_info = retrieval_augmented_generation(detected_subject)  
    return retrieved_info  
}

}

### 9. **Embedding Models**

#### Traditional CV:
- **Example**: Traditional embedding models in CV for facial recognition.
- **Use Case**: Security systems using facial recognition embeddings.

#### CV with LLMs:
- **Example**: Embedding both visual and text data to find similarities between images and textual descriptions.
- **Use Case**: Image search platforms that allow searching for visually similar items based on embeddings.
