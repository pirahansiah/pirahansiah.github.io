## Data Analysis Insights and Solutions
#### Graph Observations
- Gap Between Training and Validation Loss
  - Unrepresentative Training Data
    - Too few examples.
    - Insufficient data for learning.
  - Noisy Validation Loss Movements
    - Unrepresentative for evaluation.
    - Too few examples in validation set.
  - Validation Loss Lower Than Training Loss
    - Validation data might be easier to predict.

#### Dataset Analysis
- Under-Fitting
  - Loss remains consistent.
  - High loss values, indicating no learning.  
- Over-Fitting
  - Training loss decreases continuously.
  - Validation loss increases after a point.
  
### Solutions
- For Gap Issues
  - Enhance data representation.
  - Increase dataset size.
- For Noisy Validation Loss
  - Use a more representative validation set.
  - Increase validation set size.
- For Under-Fitting
  - Increase model complexity.
  - Train for more epochs.
- For Over-Fitting
  - Apply regularization techniques.
  - Introduce dropout layers.

## Common solutions for underfitting or overfitting 
- checking the dataset
- conducting error analysis
- choosing a different model architecture
- hyperparameter tuning

## For underfitting (reducing bias):
- Increase model complexity (bigger model)
- Decrease regularization (reduce lambda value)
- Conduct error analysis to understand bias sources
- Try different model architectures
- Tune hyperparameters to find optimal values
- Add more features or construct more complex features
- Increase the number of training epochs
- Use feature selection to include relevant features

## For overfitting (reducing variance):
- Add more training data if possible
- Implement normalization techniques (batch norm, layer norm)
- Use data augmentation to create variations of the training data
- Increase regularization (dropout, L2 regularization, weight decay)
- Conduct error analysis to understand variance sources
- Explore different model architectures
- Tune hyperparameters to balance model complexity
- Apply early stopping to prevent overtraining
- Simplify the model (reduce the number of layers/neurons)
- Perform feature selection to remove irrelevant or noisy features
- Prune the network to remove unnecessary connections or weights
- Use cross-validation to assess the model's performance on unseen data
