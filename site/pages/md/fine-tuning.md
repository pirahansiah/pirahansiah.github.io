Keywords for Fine-tuning LLMs:
Prompt Engineering: Designing effective prompts to elicit desired responses without altering the model's weights.
Few-shot Learning: Fine-tuning models on very few examples to adapt to new tasks.
Zero-shot Learning: Applying models to tasks without any task-specific training data.
Transfer Learning: Adapting a pre-trained model for a different but related task.
Meta-Learning: Training models to learn new tasks quickly with minimal data.
Techniques:
Layer Freezing: Only fine-tune specific layers of the model while keeping others frozen to save computation and prevent overfitting.
Task-specific Heads: Adding task-specific layers on top of a pre-trained model for specific tasks (e.g., classification heads).
Regularization Techniques: Applying methods like dropout, weight decay, or early stopping to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning.
Curriculum Learning: Gradually increasing the difficulty of tasks during training to improve model learning.
Data Augmentation: Generating additional training data by modifying existing examples to improve model robustness and generalization.
Weighted Loss Functions: Adjusting the loss function to prioritize certain aspects of the training data or tasks.
Dynamic Learning Rates: Adjusting the learning rate during training (e.g., learning rate schedules, warm-up periods) to improve convergence.
Multi-task Learning: Training the model on multiple tasks simultaneously to improve generalization and performance across tasks.
Contrastive Learning: Learning by comparing pairs or groups of examples to learn representations that distinguish between them.
Self-supervised Learning: Generating labels from the data itself and using these labels as supervision for model training.
Cross-lingual Transfer: Leveraging knowledge from one language to improve model performance on other languages.
Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models or fine-tuning strategies to improve performance and robustness.

Keywords for Fine-tuning LLMs:

 Techniques:

Full fine-tuning: Updates all model parameters (most memory intensive)
Adapter/bottleneck methods: Update smaller "adapter" modules instead of full weights (e.g., LoRA, Adapter-Tuning)
