        - NeRF-++
            - A method that addresses the limitations of the original NeRF by introducing a hierarchical structure for more efficient rendering.
- Gaussian Splatting
    - A technique used in graphics and visualization for smoothing or interpolating data points.
    - Other Methods
        - Kernel Density Estimation, Radial Basis Function Interpolation, Moving Least Squares.
        - Kernel Regression with Splatting
            - This technique combines Gaussian Splatting with kernel regression for improved data fitting and noise reduction.
        - Splatting CNNs
            - Integrating Gaussian Splatting with Convolutional Neural Networks for tasks like point cloud processing and image segmentation.
- Fine-Tune LLM
    - Transfer Learning
        - Leverage the knowledge from a pre-trained model and apply it to a similar but different task. This is the essence of fine-tuning.
    - Few-shot Learning
        - Provide examples of the task within the input to guide the model on how to respond. This is particularly effective with models like GPT-3.
    - Zero-shot Learning
        - Adapt the model to perform tasks without any task-specific data during training, relying on its pre-existing knowledge.
    - Prompt Engineering
        - Developing effective prompts to guide the LLM towards the desired task or output becomes increasingly crucial.
    - Continual Learning
        - Techniques that allow LLMs to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones.
