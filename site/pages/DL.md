- Transfer Learning
    - Introduction
        - Challenge: Gathering enough labeled data, computational resources, and time for new deep learning models.
        - Solution: Use of transfer learning to save time and resources.
        - Technique:
            - Pre-train a model on one task, then fine-tune it for another related task.
        - Benefits of Transfer Learning:
            - Saves time and computational resources.
            - Initial layers learn low-level features (edges, textures) useful for new tasks.
            - Reduces training requirements on large labeled data sets.
            - Leads to better generalization from pre-training on related tasks.
            - Faster training and less resource-intensive than starting from scratch.
            - Pre-trained models (often on ImageNet) bring knowledge that improves accuracy and performance on new tasks.
            - Requires substantially less labeled data for training.
            - More likely to generalize well to new, unseen data.
        - Conclusion:
            - Transfer learning enables more efficient problem-solving with less data, less computation, and less time.
    - When to Use Transfer Learning:
        - When
            - Effective for smaller or less diverse datasets than the pre-trained model's training dataset.
            - Suitable when dataset features are similar to those in the pre-training dataset.
            - For large datasets significantly different from the pre-trained model's, consider training from scratch.
        - Choosing Between Feature Extraction and Fine-Tuning:
            - Based on dataset size and similarity to the pre-trained model's task.
            - Feature extraction for smaller datasets to reduce overfitting.
            - Fine-tuning for larger datasets or to adjust pre-trained features to new tasks.
        - Scenario-based Layer Freezing Strategy:
            1. Small & Similar Dataset: Freeze weights up to the last layer, replace the fully connected layer, retrain.
            2. Large & Similar Dataset: Freeze early layers, retrain later layers with a new fully connected layer.
            3. Small & Different Dataset: Remove near-output convolutional layers, retrain closer-to-input layers.
            4. Large & Different Dataset: Retrain the entire network from scratch, replace the fully connected output layer.
        - Fine-Tuning Considerations:
            - Use a lower learning rate to avoid drastic changes to pre-trained weights.
            - Apply data augmentation techniques for smaller datasets to help the model generalize better.
        - General Tips:
            - Understand your dataset size and similarity to the pre-training dataset.
            - Leverage feature extraction for smaller, similar datasets.
            - Use fine-tuning for larger datasets similar to the original model's task.
            - Freeze layers appropriately to prevent overfitting.
            - Adjust freezing strategy based on dataset size and similarity.
            - Enhance model performance with a lower learning rate and data augmentation.            
    - Types    
        - Pre-trained Models: 
            - Serve as a starting point for new models.
            - Typically trained on large datasets like ImageNet.
            - Help overcome data availability and computational challenges.
            - When to Use Feature Extraction vs. Fine Tuning:
                - Dataset Size: Feature extraction for small datasets to avoid overfitting; fine-tuning for larger datasets.
                - Dataset Similarity: Feature extraction if new dataset is similar to pre-training dataset; fine-tuning if domains are different.
                - Computational Resources: Feature extraction is less resource-intensive and quicker; consider it if resources or time are limited.
        - Feature Extraction: 
            - Leverages learned features of pre-trained models.
            - Involves removing the last few layers and adding a new classification layer.
            - Weights of the pre-trained model are kept frozen.
            - Used when dataset is small but similar to the original pre-trained model's dataset.
            - Feature Extraction Steps:
                1. Select a Pre-trained Model: Choose one pre-trained on a large, diverse dataset (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet on ImageNet).
                2. Remove Top Layers: Modify the pre-trained model by removing its top classification layers.
                3. Add New Output Layer: Customize by adding a new output layer that matches your use case's class count.
                4. Freeze Pre-trained Layers: Make the layers non-trainable to prevent updating during new dataset training.
                5. Train the Model: Use your dataset to train only the new model's layers.
        - Fine Tuning: 
            - Adjusts pre-trained model's weights for the new task.
            - More extensive modifications than feature extraction.
            - Some layers are unfrozen to update weights during backpropagation.
            - Requires more data and resources but adapts better to new tasks.
            - The choice between feature extraction and fine tuning depends on:
            - Size and similarity of the new dataset to the original dataset.
            - Available computational resources.
            - Fine Tuning Steps:
                1. Choose and Modify Pre-trained Model: Start with selecting a pre-trained model and replace the output layer for your task.
                2. (Optional) Freeze and Train New Output Layer: Initially, you might freeze pre-trained layers to train a new output layer, improving performance.
                3. Unfreeze Some Pre-trained Layers: Update weights by unfreezing, especially later layers for task-specific features.
                4. Set Lower Learning Rate: Use a smaller learning rate to adjust pre-trained weights carefully, as the model is already close to a solution.
                5. Train the Model: Update weights of both new and some/all unfrozen pre-trained layers with the new dataset.
