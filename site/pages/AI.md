A major challenge of verifying properties of DNNs with satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers is in handling the networks activation functions such as, Reluplex (domain-specific theory solvers; through a lazy approach). 1)devising scalable verification techniques. 2)identifying design choices - amenable to verification. "Each neuron of a neural network computes a weighted sum of its inputs according to learned weights. It then passes that sum through an activation function to produce the neurons final output. Typically, the activation functions introduce nonlinearity to the network, making DNNs capable of learning arbitrarily complex functions, but also making the job of automated verification tools much harder.Driver Assistance Systems and Vision-Based System Validates Driver MonitoringVision-based convolutional neural network system detects phone usage, eating, and drinking. cameras with active infrared lighting; 30 Hz and delivered 8-bit grayscale images at 1280  1024-pixel resolution; ResNeXt-34; video-based driver assistance systems, such as automated driving; resilient object detection and tracking; camera:  50field of view (horizontal);  27 -21field of view (vertical);    150 m detection range; 2.6 MP resolution. multi path approach: classifier:  for pattern recognition;  resilient object detection dense optical flow and structure from motion; to detect static objects; 3D structuredeep learning: classify objects, road, edge road, orientation; " Operation principle of the multi purpose camera: During assisted and automated driving, the vehicle must know what is happening in its surroundings at all times. It must reliably detect objects and people, and be able to react to these appropriately. Here, the latest generation of the front video camera from Bosch plays a crucial part: The multi purpose camera for assisted and partially automated driving utilizes an innovative, high-performance system-on-chip (SoC) with a Bosch microprocessor for image-processing algorithms. Its unique multipath approach combines classic image-processing algorithms with artificial-intelligence methods for comprehensive scene interpretation and reliable object detection. With its algorithmic multipath approach and the innovative system-on-chip, this camera generation has been specially developed for high-performance driver assistance systems. In line with this approach, the multi purpose camera uses for example the following technical paths at once for image processing: The first of these is the conventional approach already in use today. Via preprogrammed algorithms, the cameras recognize the typical appearance of object categories such as vehicles, cyclists, or road markings. The second and third paths are new, however. For the second path, the camera uses the optical flow and the structure from motion (SfM) to recognize raised objects along the roadside, such as curbs, central reserves, or safety barriers. The motion of associated pixels is tracked. A three-dimensional structure is then approximated based on the two-dimensional camera image. The third path relies on artificial intelligence. Thanks to machine-learning processes, the camera has learned to classify objects such as cars parked by the side of the road. The latest generation can differentiate between surfaces on the road and those alongside the road via neuronal networks and semantic segmentation. Additional paths are used as required: These include classic line scanning, light detection, and stereo disparity.  " LinkFace recognitionattributes I use citation plugin add path to the JabRef database "reading notesdh.bib"create folder  "Reading notes"use CtrlShiftO to select reference automatically create file based on that reference CtrlShiftE to insert link to citation page Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuseThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze traffic.

You can access to all presentation hereSummary of AI HARDWARE EUROPE SUMMIT (July 2020)Some of the problems FPGAs solve:- excessive heat- electricity consumption- resistance to environmental factors and motion- lifespan  The goal is artificial general intelligence (AGI). AI software and hardware should work together to achieve this goal. A lot of research in this area work with new methods of algorithms and hardware together to achieve high performance. Most of new hardware working with TensorFlow and Pytorch. In most case new hardware come with software solution that have high performance in special use cade or scenario. However, the new hardware can be modify by programmer like Embedded FPGA (eFPGA) in order to implement their requirement. Some of the best presentations are: Machine Intelligent Systems & Software by Victoria Rege from Graphcore, Leveraging sparsity to enable ultra-low latency inferences demonstrated using GrAI One by Orlando Moreira and Remi Poittevin from GrAI Matter Labs, Challenges for Using Machine Learning in Industrial Automation by Ingo Thon from Siemens Convolutional autoencoder for anomaly detection, From Training to Production Inference for Automotive AI - Transforming Research into Reality ( From laboratory training to automotive inference: the realities of embedding AI) by Tony King-Smith and Marton Feher from AIMotive ,Towards Embedded Intelligence by Michaela Blott from Xilinx, and the last good presentation is MLIR: Accelerating Artificial Intelligence by Albert Cohen from Google. Some key words for the event: FINN is an experimental framework from Xilinx Research Labs to explore deep neural network inference on FPGAs, The MLIR project is a novel approach to building reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure, Fair and useful benchmarks for measuring training and inference performance of ML hardware, software, and services at mlperf.org, Graphcore IPU which is the new type of processor for AI with very high performance.

Algorithm like DRL, AutoML, AGI need higher computing requirements. The challenge on AI chip is tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility, AI algorithms evolve very fast which change the methods of processing,  Idiosyncratic hardware for specific domain, hyper focused on chips not in the system.   I am impress about "Accelerator Benchmarking on Read Edge-inference Applications" presentation at AI HW summit and I like to see live demo of " InferX X1" on October. Do you have any benchmarking of InferX X1 for the deep reinforcement learning? PRESENTATION: Power and Cost Efficient High Performance Inference at the EdgeGeoff Tate - Flex Logix-;  geoffflex-logix.comAccelerator Benchmarking on Read Edge-inference Applications, He talk about Embedded FPGA (eFPGA) and new product which is "inferX X1" that will come soon. It use TDP:7-13W compare to Nvidia Xavier NX 15W. He mentioned The ResNet-50 with the image size of 224224 will not tell you the robustness of the memory system that been required with megapixel images. Thats why not good for comparison the best for customer to use and compare is YOLOv3. YOLOv3 intermediate activations are 64MB peak for 2 Megapixel images, this stresses memory subsystems much more than ResNet-50. Their chip is good because of efficiency is in Data packing and transposition. It allowed efficiency 3D convolutions which for each layer ad dedicated path RAM to compute to RAM and deep layer fusion reduces memory requirement and DRAM access in "hidden" in the background.      Embedded FPGA, eFPGA, clustering MACs with a reconfigurable interconnect delivered high inference throughput at low cost, inferX X1 in fab now TDP:7-13W (compare to Nvidia Xavier NX 15W), not Pytorch, the best for customer to use and compare is YOLOv3. YOLOv3 intermediate activations are 64MB peak for 2 Megapixel images, this stresses memory subsystems much more than ResNet-50. They said the normal default image size is 224224 but the activation intermediate (max layer) growth exponentially by increasing the size of images.     The ResNet-50 with the image size of 224224 will not tell you the robustness of the memory system that been required with megapixel images. Thats why not good for comparison. Nvidia Xavier NX: has 3 inference (GPU, 2x DLA):self-driving car multiple models are running simultaneously But in most AI system one camera one model one system process images frame per frame. If we have stream of data coming in 15FPS one image at time 15FPS   Key to inferX X1 efficiency is in Data packing and transposition, efficiency 3D convolutions , for each layer ad dedicated path RAM to compute to RAM, deep layer fusion reduces memory requirement, DRAM access in "hidden" in the background, TSMC,GUC,synopsys,arteris,analog bits, cadence, mentor  I am impress about "Machine Intelligent Systems & Software GRAPHCORE IPU" presentation at AI HW summit.

Event based computation of networks (process only the data that change); single events in an input layer fan out (typically 1:9 to 1:49 per feature map); only the affected pixels in the convolutional layer need be computed. ; locality of change is preserved downstream. ; the events than fan in typically 4:1 in pooling layers. ; additionally, events are only 25 likely to change the pixel state (tpy. 22 max pooling).; locality of change is preserved downstream. ;       sparNet: sparse and event-based execution modelExploits time-sparsity in a time seriesConverts frame.

These parameters can be used to correct for lens distortion, measure the size of an object in world units, or determine the location of the camera in a scene. These tasks are used in applications such as machine vision to detect and measure objects. They are also used in robotics, navigation systems, and 3-D scene reconstruction. Without any knowledge of the calibration of the cameras, it is impossible to do better than projective reconstruction (MathWorks).Non-intrusive scene measurement tasks, such as 3D reconstruction, object inspection, target or self-localization or scene mapping require a calibrated camera model (Orghidan et al. 2011). Camera calibration is the process of approximating the parameters of a pinhole camera model (Tsai 1987; Stein 1995; Heikkila & Silven 1997) of a given photograph or video.There are four main categories of camera calibration methods whereby a number of algorithms have been proposed for each categoriesmethods, namely knowing object based camera calibration, semi auto calibration, camera self-calibration method, and camera calibration method based on active vision. In computer vision methods, image information from cameras can yield geometric information pertaining to three-dimensional objects. Non-intrusive scene measurement tasks, such as 3D reconstruction, object inspection, target or self-localization, or scene mapping require a calibrated camera model (Orghidan et al. 2011). The correlation between the geographical point and camera image pixel is necessary for camera calibration. Hence, the cameras parameter, which constitutes the geometric model of camera imaging, are utilized to establish the correlation between the three-dimensional geometric location of one point and a corresponding point in an image (Wang et al. 2010). Typically, experiments are conducted to attain the aforementioned parameters and relevant calculation, which is a process called camera calibration (Hyunjoon et al. 2014; Jianyang et al. 2014; Mohedano et al. 2014; Navarro et al. 2014).Image information from cameras can be used to elucidate the geometric information of a 3D object. The process of estimating the parameters of a pinhole camera model is called camera calibration. The more accurate the estimated parameters, the better the compensation that can be performed for the next stage of the application. In the data collection stage, a camera will take photos of a camera calibration pattern(Tsai 1987; Stein 1995; Heikkila & Silven 1997; Zhengyou 2000). Another angle of the issue is to create a set of pair images from both cameras via high quality images and increased range of slope of calibration pattern. The current methods simply create images upon the detection of calibration pattern. Nonetheless, the consensus in literature is that accurate camera calibration necessitates pure rotation (Zhang et al. 2008) and require sharp images. Recent breakthrough methods, such as Zhangs (Zhengyou 2000), use fixed threshold to elucidate pixel difference between the frames and pre-setting variables, where slope information for image frame selection in camera calibration phase has been neglected (Audet & Okutomi 2009). Conversely, these approaches become less reliable when image frames are blurred. These problems necessitates that the camera calibration algorithm be enhanced (Wang et al. 2010).OpenCVDeep Learning Engineering of Camera CalibrationOccasionally the out-of-the-box solution does not work, and you need some modified version of the algorithms.The first step of camera calibration is using known pattern images, such as chessboard. However, sometimes the image quality and pattern are not match with standard approach of calibration process.I use some other technique to enhance the result. In the first step, we need to improve the corner detection, and it may be done by fallowing steps.     The chessboard is used as a pattern of alternating black and white squares,     -    which ensures that there is no bias toward     one side or the other in measurement.

Some common revenue streams for accelerators and incubators include:Sponsorship - Many accelerators and incubators are sponsored by corporations, foundations, or government agencies, who provide funding in exchange for branding, marketing, or other benefits.Equity Investment - Some accelerators and incubators do take equity in the startups they support, which allows them to earn a return on their investment if the startup is successful.Program Fees - Some accelerators and incubators charge startups a fee to participate in their programs, which may include access to mentorship, resources, or networking opportunities.Consulting or Advisory Services - Some accelerators and incubators may offer consulting or advisory services to startups for a fee.Event or Conference Revenue - Some accelerators and incubators may host events or conferences, which can generate revenue through ticket sales, sponsorships, or exhibitor fees.grant  loanA grant or a loan can be an attractive option for startups that are looking for funding but do not want to give up equity in their company.A grant is a sum of money that is given to a startup with no obligation to pay it back. Grants are often offered by government agencies, non-profit organizations, or foundations that want to support innovation and entrepreneurship in a particular sector or industry. Grants can be highly competitive, and startups typically have to submit a detailed proposal outlining their business plan, goals, and how they plan to use the funds.A loan, on the other hand, is a sum of money that is borrowed from a lender with the obligation to pay it back over a specified period of time, usually with interest. Loans can be offered by banks, government agencies, or private investors. Startups typically have to submit a detailed business plan and financial projections to qualify for a loan. Loans can be a good option for startups that have a solid plan for revenue generation but need some initial capital to get started.Both grants and loans can provide startups with much-needed funding to help them get off the ground. However, it's important to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any funding agreement before accepting it. Startups should make sure that they understand the repayment terms, interest rates, and any other fees or requirements associated with the grant or loan.sole proprietorship (Einzelunternehmen)Investor Database0. fundraising content 1. alternative datases accelerator incubator business angels competitions  conferences investors investor matching  public funding startups2. alternative funding options crowd investments europe family offices europepubluic funding germany3. programs accelerator  incubator DACH-Region Company builder DACH-Region innovation labs DACH-Region4. business angels business angels germany business angels europe carta5.

While storage becomes cheaper and smaller, developers find creative ways to increase code size by adding features or unnecessary software engineering. Compilers have come a long way in optimizing applications for code size. While most compiler optimization work were focused on application performance, we have seen increase in the code size optimizations in recent years. This session will cover classical as well as recent compiler optimizations for code size, a few of which Aditya has implemented in the LLVM compiler. Some optimizations (hot cold splitting, function entry instrumentation) require collecting data from the field while the application is running. The presentation will provide an overview of how those compiler techniques help reduce code size. We will also explore some tips and techniques (compiler flags to reduce code size, tuning of compiler options like inline threshold), that help reduce binary size. Having knowledge of the code generated by the compiler and the instruction set architecture can help engineers chose appropriate programming abstractions and idioms.

Use assertions to validate function arguments .Strip undefined behavior from your code, or use assertions to catch illegal uses of undefined behavior .Don't waste people's time. Document unclear assertions .Either remove implicit assumptions, or assert that they are valid .Use assertions to detect impossible conditions.Don't hide bugs when you program defensively.Use a second algorithm to validate your results.Don't wait for bugs to happen; use startup checks.Chapter 3Maintain shipping and debugging versions of your program. Shrink-wrap the shipping version, but use the debugging version as much as possible to catch bugs quickly.Assertions are a shorthand way to write debugging checks. Use them to catch illegal conditions that should never arise. Don't confuse such conditions with error conditions, which you must handle in the final product.Use assertions to validate function arguments and to alert pro grammars when they do something undefined. The more rigidly you define your functions, the easier it will be to validate the arguments.Once you've written a function, review it and  ask  yourself,  'What am I assuming?" If you find an assumption, either assert that your assumption is always valid, or rewrite the code to re move the assumption. Also ask, 'What is most likely  to  be  wrong in this code, and how can I automatically detect the problem?" Strive to implement tests that catch bugs at the earliest possible moment. Textbooks encourage programmers to program defensively, but remember that this coding style hides bugs. When you write defensive code, use assertions to alert you if the "can't happen" cases do happen.Eliminate random behavior. Force bugs to be reproducible .Destroy your garbage so that it's not misused .Not only did reallocate have to move the block of memory as it was expanding it, but the old memory had to be reallocated and filled with new data. In the assembler, both happened rarely.This brings up another guideline for writing bug-free code: You don't want anything to happen rarely. You need to isolate those behaviors in your subsystems that may happen and make sure that they do happen. And of ten. If you find rare behavior in your subsystems, be sure to do something anything-to  stir  things up.The assembler bug could have been found within hours, instead of years, if reallocate hadn't so rarely moved blocks when it expanded  them.  If something happens rarely, force it to happen often.Keep debug information to allow stronger error checking.There is no question  that  the debug  code will create  differences  be tween the ship and the debug versions of your code, but as long as you're careful not to change the underlying behavior of the code, those differences shouldn't matter. Create thorough subsystem checks, and use them often.Design your tests carefully. Nothing should be arbitrary.Strive to implement transparent integrity checks.Don't apply ship version constraints to the debug version. Trade size and speed for error detection.Chapter 4Don't wait until you have a bug to step through your code.Step through every code path.What About Sweeping Changes? In the past, programmers have asked, "What if I add a feature that touches code in many places? Stepping through all that new code is going to be time consuming." Let me answer that question with another: Can you make such sweeping changes without introducing any bugs? The habit of stepping through your code creates an interesting negative feedback loop. Programmers who step through their code soon learn to write small, easily testable functions because stepping through large functions is so painful. Programmers also spend more time thinking about how they can localize the changes they need to make-again, so that they can more easily test their code. And isn't this exactly what you want? No project lead likes it when programmers touch a lot of code; it's too destabilizing. Nor do leads like large, unmanageable functions; they're often unmaintainable. Try hard to localize your changes. If you find that you must make pervasive changes,  think  twice  before  you  decide  not  to step through  all the new code.Overflow and underflow bugsData conversion bugsOff-by-one bugsNULL pointer bugsBugs using garbage memory (0xA3 bugs)Assignment bugs in which you've used  instead of Precedence bugsLogic bugsAs you step through code, focus on data flow. Source level debuggers can hide execution details. Step through critical code at the instruction level .Chapter 5Make it hard to ignore error conditions. Don't bury error codes in return values.Always look for, and eliminate, flaws in your interfaces.Don't write multipurpose functions. Write separate functions to allow stronger argument validation.Don't be wishy-washy. Define explicit function arguments.Write functions that, given valid inputs, cannot fail.Make the code intelligible at the point of call. Avoid  Boolean arguments.Write comments that emphasize potential hazards.Chapter 6Use well-defined data types.Always ask ,"Can this variable or expression  over- or underflow?"Implement your designs as accurately as possible. Being kind a close is being kind a buggy. these principles already: Don't accept special purpose arguments such as the NULL pointer, and Implement your design, not something that approximates it. The third principle is new: Strive to make every function perform its task exactly one time. Implement "the task" just once.Get rid of extraneous if statements.Avoid using nested ?: operators .Handle your special cases just once.Avoid risky language idioms.Don't needlessly mix operator types. If you must mix operators, use parentheses to isolate the operations.Avoid calling functions that return errors.Chapter 7Don't reference memory that you don't own.Don't reference memory that you have freed.Don't use output memory as workspace buffers.Don't  pass data in static (or global) memory.Don't write parasitic functions.Don't abuse your programming language.Tight C does not guarantee efficient machine code.Write code for the "average" programmer.Chapter 8Bugs don't  just "go away."Don't fix bugs later; fix them now.Fix the cause, not the symptom.Don't clean up code unless the clean up is critical to the product's success.Don't implement nonstrategic features.There are no free features.Don't allow unnecessary  flexibility.Don't keep "trying"  solutions until you find one that works. Take the time to find the correct solution.Write and test code in small chunks.Always test your code, even if that means your schedule will slip.Don't rely on the testing group to find your bugs.Don't blame testers for finding your bugs.Establish your priorities and stick to them.Never allow the same bug to bite you twice.A: CODING CHECKLISTSB: MEMORY LOGGING ROUTINESTo sum up Charles Simonyi in the early 1970s.   ch;byte  b;flag  f; flags that are always TRUE or FALSEsymbol sym; some sort of symbol structurechar byte flag symbolpch: character pointerpb;pf:psym:related link:  Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters Six-week cycles: Our decisions are based on moving the product forward in the next six weeks, not micromanaging time. We dont count hours or question how individual days are spent. We dont have daily meetings. We dont rethink our roadmap every two weeks. Our focus is at a higher level. We say to ourselves: If this project ships after six weeks, well be really happy. Well feel our time was well spent. Then we commit the six weeks and leave the team alone to get it doneShaping the work: key elements of a solution, appetitepart one shaping:two separate tracks: one for shaping, one for building.

Write the pitch.fixed time, variable scope,Where in the current system does the new thing fit? How do you get to it? What are the key components or interactions? Where does it take you?five ingredients that we always want to include in a pitch:  1. Problem  The raw idea, a use case, or something weve seen that motivates us to work on this 2. Appetite  How much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution  3. Solution  The core elements we came up with, presented in a form thats easy for people to immediately understand  4. Rabbit holes  Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems   5. No-gos  Anything specifically excluded from the concept: functionality or use cases we intentionally arent covering to fit the appetite or make the problem tractablepart two : BettingSome companies use two-week cycles (aka sprints). We learned that two weeks is too short to get anything meaningful done. Worse than that, two-week cycles are extremely costly due to the planning overhead. The amount of work you get out of two weeks isnt worth the collective hours around the table to sprint plan or the opportunity cost of breaking everyones momentum to re-group.after each six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for cool-down. bugs: Use cool-down. Bring it to the betting table.  Schedule a bug smash.Weve noticed three phases of work when we build a new product from scratch. R&D mode (bet the time on spiking some key pieces of the new product idea. CEO and designer, we dont expect to ship anything at the end of an R&D cycle) , Production mode (Shaping is deliberate again. bet multiple teams in parallel , Shipping is the goal) , Cleanup mode (Theres no shaping. There arent clear team boundaries. Work is shipped) Cleanup shouldnt last longer than two cyclesExample:  two years of development,  R&D mode for the first year, a year of production mode cycles followed, two cycles of cleanup and significantly cut back the feature set, some overlap between R&D and production mode after that first year,      Part three: BuildingWe dont start by assigning tasks to anyone.  we define and track the scopes as to-do lists.

In this course, well largely focus on AI at the Edge using the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO Toolkit.First, well start off with pre-trained models available in the OpenVINO Open Model Zoo. Even without needing huge amounts of your own data and costly training, you can deploy powerful models already created for many applications.Next, youll learn about the Model Optimizer, which can take a model you trained in frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe and more, and create an Intermediate Representation (IR) optimized for inference with OpenVINO and Intel hardware.Third, youll learn about the Inference Engine, where the actual inference is performed on the IR model.Lastly, we'll hit some more topics on deploying at the edge, including things like handling input streams, processing model outputs, and the lightweight MQTT architecture used to publish data from your edge models to the web.

Add a command line argument to allow for different bounding box colors for the outputSimilarly, I added the -c argument for inputting a bounding box color.Note that in my approach, I chose to only allow "RED", "GREEN" and "BLUE", which alsoimpacts what I'll do in the next step; there are many possible approaches here.optional.addargument("-c", help"The color of the bounding boxes to draw; RED, GREEN or BLUE", default'BLUE') Correctly utilize the command line arguments in  and  within the applicationBoth of these will come into play within the drawboxes function. For the first, a new lineshould be added before extracting the bounding box points that check whether box2(e.g. the probability of a given box) is above args.ct - assuming you have added args.ct as an argument passed to the drawboxes function. If not, the boxshould not be drawn. Without this, any random box will be drawn, which could be a ton ofvery unlikely bounding box detections. app.pyimport argparseimport cv2from inference import NetworkINPUTSTREAM  "testvideo.mp4"CPUEXTENSION  "optintelopenvinodeploymenttoolsinferenceenginelibintel64libcpuextensionsse4.so"def getargs():    '''    Gets the arguments from the command line.

The versioning of different deep learning frameworks are crucial. For example the latest version of OS for Jetson Nano Jetpack which use latest CUDA but the Pytorch only support up to 10.1 now. So we need to install lower Jetpack version on Jetson Nano or compile the Pytorch. I compile Pytorch and it takes few hours with a lot of issue to solve. For the Ubuntu 20 there is not support for CUDA 10 you need install CUDA 11 and compile the Pytorch with a lot of library. install CUDA 10.x on Ubuntu 20 is possible but takes time to solve conflicts also supporting eGPU is another issue for lower ubuntu. On MacOS installing everything is easy because of not supporting GPU but many library and frameworks of the source codes of tracking require GPU version. Even install CPU version of all library does not grantee to run tracking methods. Another aspect is speed. Running tracking even on GPU is very slow based on my experience using Yolo version 3 which is one of the fastest object detection on GTX 2070 can process up to 15 FPS with Full HD videos. Methods on tracking is very different. First generation, it is completely based on computer vision. The second generation combining Kalman filter and advanced computer vision (SIFT), the third generation using deep learning and some of the methods of previous generation like Kalman filter. The fourth generation using combination of two deep learning methods. And the latest generation using complete end to end models like RNN. Object tracking works with all combination of environments such as, moving objects, moving objects and camera in dynamic environments. As long as object appear in the frame until disappeared it the tracking can track and identification as one objects. No mater how many FPS.TrackingClassic object tracking classic feature detection (SIFT and SURF), combined with a machine learning algorithm like KNN or SVM for classification, or with a description matcher like FLANN for object detection.Kalman filtering, sparse and dense optical flow, Example: Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT), which uses a combination of the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter SOT is a hot topic in the last decade. Early visual tracking methods rely on extracting hand-crafted features of candidate target regions, and use matching algorithms or hand-crafted discriminative classifiers to generate tracking results.The MOT track aims to recover the trajectories of objects in video sequences, which is an important problem in computer vision with many applications, such as surveillance, activity analysis, and sport video analysis.Video object detection datasets. The video object detection task aims to detect objects of different categories in video sequences. Multi-object tracking datasetslarge-scale benchmark Multi-Class Multi-object tracking datasetsVisDrone datasets is captured in various unconstrained scenes, focusing on four core problems in computer vision fields, i.e., image object detection, video object detection, single object tracking, and multi- object tracking.the accuracy of detection methods suffers from degenerated object appearances in videos such as motion blur, pose variations, and video de-focus. Exploiting temporal coherence and aggregating features in consecutive frames might to be two effective ways to handle such issue.Temporal coherence. A feasible way to exploit temporal coherence is using object trackersFeature aggregation.

Here are several examples of clean code in OpenCV C:Meaningful variable names:cv::Mat originalimage  cv::imread("image.jpg");cv::Mat resizedimage;cv::resize(originalimage, resizedimage, cv::Size(), 0.5, 0.5, cv::INTERAREA);Use of high-level functions:cv::Mat src  cv::imread("image.jpg");cv::Mat dst;cv::GaussianBlur(src, dst, cv::Size(3,3), 0);Error handling:cv::Mat src  cv::imread("image.jpg");if(src.empty())     std::cout  corners;cv::goodFeaturesToTrack(src, corners, 100, 0.01, 10);Reusable functions:cv::Mat src  cv::imread("image.jpg");cv::Mat gray;cv::cvtColor(src, gray, cv::COLORBGR2GRAY);cv::Mat sharpenimage(const cv::Mat& image)     cv::Mat result;    cv::GaussianBlur(image, result, cv::Size(0,0), 3);    cv::addWeighted(image, 1.5, result, -0.5, 0, result);    return result;cv::Mat sharpened  sharpenimage(gray);Clear and concise comments: Load the source imagecv::Mat src  cv::imread("image.jpg"); Convert the image to grayscalecv::Mat gray;cv::cvtColor(src, gray, cv::COLORBGR2GRAY); Threshold the image to create a binary imagecv::Mat thresholded;cv::threshold(gray, thresholded, 128, 255, cv::THRESHBINARY);docthis code shows information about imagecode docthis code shows information about imagecode Google SitesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuseThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze traffic.

We were lucky to have you, as the external reviewers of this work. I hope this is useful for the research community. Any feedback will be highly welcomed. You can find its summary here too.

Clearly were missing something big.In 2021, I expect self-supervised methods to learn features of video and images. Could there be a similar revolution in high-dimensional continuous data like video?One critical challenge is dealing with uncertainty. Models like BERT cant tell if a missing word in a sentence is cat or dog, but they can produce a probability distribution vector. We dont have a good model of probability distributions for images or video frames. But recent research is coming so close that were likely to find it soon.Suddenly well get really good performance predicting actions in videos with very few training samples, where it wasnt possible before. That would make the coming year a very exciting time in AI.DeepMind released the code, model, & dataset behind their groundbreaking "AlphaFold" system.

This course introduces you to statistical learning techniques where an agent explicitly takes actions and interacts with the world. Understanding the importance and challenges of learning agents that make decisions is of vital importance today, with more and more companies interested in interactive agents and intelligent decision-making.This course introduces you to the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning. When you finish this course, you will: - Formalize problems as Markov Decision Processes - Understand basic exploration methods and the explorationexploitation tradeoff - Understand value functions, as a general-purpose tool for optimal decision-making - Know how to implement dynamic programming as an efficient solution approach to an industrial control problem This course teaches you the key concepts of Reinforcement Learning, underlying classic and modern algorithms in RL. After completing this course, you will be able to start using RL for real problems, where you have or can specify the MDP. This is the first course of the Reinforcement Learning Specialization.SHOW ALL ABOUT A COURSE IN THIS SPECIALIZATIONSHOW ALLCourse2Sample-based Learning Methods4.8stars397 ratings75 reviewsIn this course, you will learn about several algorithms that can learn near optimal policies based on trial and error interaction with the environment---learning from the agents own experience. Learning from actual experience is striking because it requires no prior knowledge of the environments dynamics, yet can still attain optimal behavior. We will cover intuitively simple but powerful Monte Carlo methods, and temporal difference learning methods including Q-learning. We will wrap up this course investigating how we can get the best of both worlds: algorithms that can combine model-based planning (similar to dynamic programming) and temporal difference updates to radically accelerate learning.By the end of this course you will be able to: - Understand Temporal-Difference learning and Monte Carlo as two strategies for estimating value functions from sampled experience - Understand the importance of exploration, when using sampled experience rather than dynamic programming sweeps within a model - Understand the connections between Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming and TD. - Implement and apply the TD algorithm, for estimating value functions - Implement and apply Expected Sarsa and Q-learning (two TD methods for control) - Understand the difference between on-policy and off-policy control - Understand planning with simulated experience (as opposed to classic planning strategies) - Implement a model-based approach to RL, called Dyna, which uses simulated experience - Conduct an empirical study to see the improvements in sample efficiency when using DynaSHOW ALL ABOUT A COURSE IN THIS SPECIALIZATIONSHOW ALLCourse3Prediction and Control with Function Approximation4.8stars252 ratings40 reviewsIn this course, you will learn how to solve problems with large, high-dimensional, and potentially infinite state spaces. You will see that estimating value functions can be cast as a supervised learning problem---function approximation---allowing you to build agents that carefully balance generalization and discrimination in order to maximize reward. We will begin this journey by investigating how our policy evaluation or prediction methods like Monte Carlo and TD can be extended to the function approximation setting. You will learn about feature construction techniques for RL, and representation learning via neural networks and backprop. We conclude this course with a deep-dive into policy gradient methods; a way to learn policies directly without learning a value function. In this course you will solve two continuous-state control tasks and investigate the benefits of policy gradient methods in a continuous-action environment.Prerequisites: This course strongly builds on the fundamentals of Courses 1 and 2, and learners should have completed these before starting this course.

This capstone will let you see how each component---problem formulation, algorithm selection, parameter selection and representation design---fits together into a complete solution, and how to make appropriate choices when deploying RL in the real world. This project will require you to implement both the environment to stimulate your problem, and a control agent with Neural Network function approximation. In addition, you will conduct a scientific study of your learning system to develop your ability to assess the robustness of RL agents. To use RL in the real world, it is critical to (a) appropriately formalize the problem as an MDP, (b) select appropriate algorithms, (c ) identify what choices in your implementation will have large impacts on performance and (d) validate the expected behaviour of your algorithms. This capstone is valuable for anyone who is planning on using RL to solve real problems.To be successful in this course, you will need to have completed Courses 1, 2, and 3 of this Specialization or the equivalent. By the end of this course, you will be able to: Complete an RL solution to a problem, starting from problem formulation, appropriate algorithm selection and implementation and empirical study into the effectiveness of the solution.SHOW ALL ABOUT A COURSE IN THIS SPECIALIZATIONSHOW ALL Using pre trained model to train deeper and lager modelImitation Learning Safety Gym, a suite of environments and tools for measuring progress towards reinforcement learning agents that respect safety constraints while training. It also provides a standardized method of comparing algorithms and how well they avoid costly mistakes while learning. If deep reinforcement learning is applied to the real world, whether in robotics or internet-based tasks, it will be important to have algorithms that are safe even while learninglike a self-driving car that can learn to avoid accidents without actually having to experience them. Credit: Two Minute Papers, OpenAI Follow me for more AI Datascience posts:  Safety Gym: A Safe Place For AIs To Learn   DeepMind proposes novel way to train safe reinforcement learning AI  The Batch Issue 35Different Skills From Different DemosReinforcement learning trains models by trial and error. In batch reinforcement learning (BRL), models learn by observing many demonstrations by a variety of actors. For instance, a robot might learn how to fix ingrown toenails by watching hundreds of surgeons perform the procedure. But what if one doctor is handier with a scalpel while another excels at suturing? A new method lets models absorb the best skills from each.Whats new: Ajay Mandlekar and collaborators at Nvidia, Stanford, and the University of Toronto devised a BRL technique that enables models to learn different portions of a task from different examples. This way, the model can gain useful information from inconsistent examples. Implicit Reinforcement without Interaction at Scale (IRIS) achieved state-of-the-art BRL performance in three tasks performed in a virtual environment.Key insight: Learning from demonstrations is a double-edged sword. An agent gets to see how to complete a task, but the scope of its action is limited to the most complete demonstration of a given task. IRIS breaks down tasks into sequences of intermediate subgoals. Then it performs the actions required to accomplish each subgoal. In this way, the agent learns from the best parts of each demonstration and combines them to accomplish the task.How it works: IRIS includes a subgoal selection model that predicts intermediate points on the way to accomplishing an assigned task. These subgoals are defined automatically by the algorithm, and may not correspond to parts of a task as humans would describe them. A controller network tries to replicate the optimal sequence of actions leading to a given subgoal.The subgoal selection model is made up of a conditional variational autoencoder that produces a set of possible subgoals and a value function (trained via a BRL version of Q-learning) that predicts which next subgoal will lead to the highest reward.The controller is a recurrent neural network that decides on the actions required to accomplish the current subgoal. It learns to predict how demonstrations tend to unfold, and to imitate short sequences of actions from specific demonstrations.Once its trained, the subgoal selection model determines the next subgoal. The controller takes the requisite actions. Then the subgoal selection model evaluates the current state and computes a new subgoal, and so on.Results: In the Robosuite's lifting and pick-and-place tasks, previous state-of-the-art BRL approaches couldn't pick up objects reliably, nor place them elsewhere at all. IRIS learned to pick up objects with over 80 percent success and placed them with 30 percent success.Why it matters: Automatically identifying subgoals has been a holy grail in reinforcement learning, with active research in hierarchical RL and other areas. The method used in this paper applies to relatively simple tasks where things happen in a predictable sequence (such as picking and then placing), but might be a small step in an important direction.Were thinking: Batch reinforcement learning is useful when a model must be interpretable or safe  after all, a robotic surgeon shouldnt experiment on living patients  but it hasnt been terribly effective. IRIS could make it a viable option.   Dec 11, 2019Issue 34   Seeing the World BlindfoldedIn reinforcement learning, if researchers want an agent to have an internal representation of its environment, theyll build and train a world model that it can refer to. New research shows that world models can emerge from standard training, rather than needing to be built separately.Whats new: Google Brain researchers C. Daniel Freeman, Luke Metz, and David Ha enabled an agent to build a world model by blindfolding it as it learned to accomplish tasks. They call their approach observational dropout.Key insight: Blocking an agent's observations of the world at random moments forces it to generate its own internal representation to fill in the gaps. The agent learns this representation without being instructed to predict how the environment will change in response to its actions.How it works: At every timestep, the agent acts on either its observation (framed in red in the video above) or its prediction of what it wasnt able to observe (imagery not framed in red). The agent contains a controller that decides on the most rewarding action. To compute the potential reward of a given action, the agent includes an additional deep net trained using the RL algorithm REINFORCE.Observational dropout blocks the agent from observing the environment according to a user-defined probability. When this happens, the agent predicts an observation.If random blindfolding blocks several observations in a row, the agent uses its most recent prediction to generate the next one.This procedure over many iterations produces a sequence of observations and predictions. The agent learns from this sequence, and its ability to predict blocked observations is tantamount to a world model.Results: Observational dropout solved the task known as Cartpole, in which the model must balance a pole upright on a rolling cart, even when its view of the world was blocked 90 percent of the time. In a more complex Car Racing task, in which a model must navigate a car around a track as fast as possible, the model performed almost equally well whether it was allowed to see its surroundings or blindfolded up to 60 percent of the time.Why it matters: Modeling reality is often part art and part science. World models generated by observational dropout arent perfect representations, but theyre sufficient for some tasks. This work could lead to simple-but-effective world models of complex environments that are impractical to model completely.Were thinking: Technology being imperfect, observational dropout is a fact of life, not just a research technique. A self-driving car or auto-piloted airplane reliant on sensors that drop data points could create a catastrophe. This technique could make high-stakes RL models more robust.  Dec 4, 2019Issue 33   Is AI Making Mastery Obsolete?Is there any reason to continue playing games that AI has mastered? Ask the former champions who have been toppled by machines.What happened: In 2016, International Go master Lee Sedol famously lost three out of four matches to DeepMinds AlphaGo model. The 36-year-old announced his retirement from competition on November 27. Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated, he told South Korean's Yonhap News Agency,Stages of grief: Prior to the tournament, Lee predicted that he would defeat AlphaGo easily. But the models inexplicable  and indefatigable  playing style pushed him into fits of shock and disbelief. Afterward, he apologized for his failure to the South Korean public.Reaching acceptance: Garry Kasparov, the former world-champion chess player, went through his own cycle of grief after being defeated by IBMs DeepBlue in 1997. Although he didnt retire, Kasparov did accuse IBMs engineers of cheating. He later retracted the charge, and in 2017 wrote a book arguing that, if humans can overcome their feelings of being threatened by AI, they can learn from it. The book advocates an augmented intelligence in which humans and machines work together to solve problems.The human element: Although AlphaGo won in the 2016 duel, its human opponent still managed to shine. During the fourth match, Sedol made a move so unconventional it defied AlphaGos expectation and led to his sole victory.Were thinking: Lee wasn't defeated by a machine alone. He was beaten by a machine built by humans under the direction of AlphaGo research lead David Silver. Human mastery is obsolete only if you ignore people like Silver and his team.

With aliases, you can write your own Git commands that do anything you want.Eg: git config --global alias.ac '!git add -A && git commit -m' (alias called ac, git add -A && git commit -m  will do the full add and commit). The revert command simply allows us to undo any commit on the current branch.Eg: git revert 486bdb2Another way: git revert HEAD  (for recent commits). This command lets you easily see the recent commits, pulls, resets, pushes, etc on your local machine.Eg: git reflog.  Gives you the ability to print out a pretty log of your commitsbranches.Eg: git log --graph --decorate --oneline.  One can also use the log command to search for specific changes in the code.Eg: git log -S "A promise in JavaScript is very similar". This command will stash (store them locally) all your code changes but does not actually commit them.Eg: git stash.   This command will delete all the tracking information for branches that are on your local machine that are not in the remote repository, but it does not delete your local branches.Eg: git remote update --prune.

In this video, we're going to explore how computer vision technology can be used to enhance IoT and cloud-based systems, and how it can be used to unlock new possibilities for businesses and consumers alike.Body: First, let's talk about what computer vision is and how it works. Essentially, computer vision is the technology that enables computers to understand and interpret visual information from the world around us. This can include things like images, videos, and even 3D models. One of the key ways that computer vision can be used to enhance IoT and cloud-based systems is by enabling devices to better understand and interact with their environment. For example, a computer vision-enabled camera could be used to monitor a manufacturing facility and identify when a machine is in need of maintenance or when an employee is working in an unsafe manner. Another way that computer vision can be used to enhance IoT and cloud-based systems is by enabling devices to better understand and interact with people. For example, a computer vision-enabled security camera could be used to identify individuals and track their movements, or a computer vision-enabled smart home system could be used to detect when someone is in the room and adjust the lighting or temperature accordingly. Additionally, computer vision can also be used to enhance cloud-based systems by providing more accurate data and insights. For example, a computer vision-enabled drone could be used to collect data on crops and provide farmers with more accurate information about the health and growth of their crops.Conclusion: Overall, computer vision technology has the potential to unlock new possibilities for businesses and consumers alike, by enabling IoT and cloud-based systems to better understand and interact with their environment and people. We hope this video has provided you with a better understanding of the potential of computer vision for IoT and cloud, and we look forward to seeing the new possibilities that will be created as this technology continues to evolve.Excited to share my latest project using computer vision and IoT to improve efficiency in manufacturing.

Motion estimation algorithms often use a similarity transform to handle camera translations, rotations, and zooming. The tricky part is getting these algorithms to lock onto the background motion, 0. video frames captured during fast motion are often blurry. Their appearance can be improved either using deblurring techniques (Section 10.3) or stealing sharper pixels from other frames with less motion or better focus (Matsushita, Ofek, Ge et al. 2006). Exercise 8.3 has you implement and test some of these ideas. 1. Background subtraction 2. Motion estimation 3. Motion smoothing 4. Image warping. image warping can result in missing borders around the image, which must be cropped, filled using information from other frames, or hallucinated using inpainting techniques (Section 10.5.1).   Vision stabilization  There is much recent work on  Multi-view 3D reconstruction is a central research topic in computer vision that is driven in many different directions There are many available methods that can handle the noisy image completion problem  In the case of surveillance using a fixed camera, there is no desired motion. In the case of most robotic applications, horizontal and vertical motions are desired, but rotation is not. In some cases of ground vehicles where the terrain is known to have many incline changes, or with aerial vehicles undergoing complicated maneuvers where the vehicles body is meant to be in varying orientations, rotation might be desired as the robot is meant to be at an angle at times.  In robotics applications, computational complexity is extremely important due to the need for real-time operation. Also, it is likely that the center of rotation will not lie in the center of the image frame because the camera is rarely mounted at the robots center of mass.    This first assumption is made in many video stabilization algorithms, and is a convenient way to seed the correct features with higher trust values. It is not an unreasonable assumption to make. Depending on the application, there is often a large portion of frames where local motion does not occur. In some situations, such as monitoring of steady traffic, there is no guarantee that local motion will not occur. This situation has not been tested, nor has our algorithm been designed to handle it. The second assumption comes from a combination of common sense, and the experience of many computer vision researchers. It makes sense that an object in the scene which does not move will be recognized more easily and more often. Being recognized consistently and consecutively is considered stable. On the other hand, objects which have local motion are less likely to be recognized as often. They might move through shadows, change orientation, or even move completely out of the scene. These possibilities all lead to a less stable class of features. It is likely that, more often than not, there are more background features than foreground features. Moving objects generally cover a small portion of the screen, which usually yields fewer features. Although uncommon, we did not want to make the assumption that this would occur in every frame. Certain scenes will consist of a large portion of local motion, or an object will move very close to the camera, consuming a much larger portion of the scene than the background. As long as some background features are discovered in each frame, our stabilization algorithm should succeed.  image processing tips:the image size and kernel size need to depended. the best way is to use the one variable to define the size of the image and kernel together.the coordinate of the image start at top left of the imagedisplayin order to change it to the normal coordinate you can usegrid of points; two matrix to X , Y coordinatesubtract half of W, H from X, Y in order to have normal coordinate system for our imagenow we have cartesian coordinate cartesian coordinate to polar coordinate             .          in MATLAB we can use ":"for example MatrixA(:) which means all entity of the matrix no mater how many dimensions we have but if we want to implemented in Python we can use numpy.flatten(). in the MATLAB the round is different from python. if you want same result you need implement the rand function by yourself.imgemasknp.oneslike(imagesource)255imgemaskimgemask.astype(np.uint8)imgemaskimgemask.flatten() ??? .ravel().asarraynp.logicaland( 1, 2)indexesindex for index in range(len(array1)) if array1index  Truecv2.bitwisenot(yyy)"olive" editor remove silence Questions:How to train model to add new classes?How to add a new class to an existing classifier in deep learning?Adding new Class to One Shot Learning trained modelIs it possible to train a neural network as new classes are given?Merging all several models that detection system for all these tasks.Answer 1:There are several ways to add new classes to the trained model, which require just training for the new classes.Incremental training (GitHub)continuously learn a stream of data (GitHub)online machine learning (GitHub)Transfer Learning TwiceContinual learning approaches (Regularization, Expansion, Rehearsal) (GitHub)Answer 2:Online learning is a term used to refer to a model which takes a continual or sequential stream of input data while training, in contrast to offline learning (also called batch learning), where the model is pre-trained on a static predefined dataset.Continual learning (also called incremental, continuous, lifelong learning) refers to a branch of ML working in an online learning context where models are designed to learn new tasks while maintaining performance on historic tasks. It can be applied to multiple problem paradigms (including Class-incremental learning, where each new task presents new class labels for an ever expanding super-classification problem).Do I need to train my whole model again on all four classes or is there any way I can just train my model on new class?Naively re-training the model on the updated dataset is indeed a solution. Continual learning seeks to address contexts where access to historic data (i.e. the original 3 classes) is not possible, or when retraining on an increasingly large dataset is impractical (for efficiency, space, privacy etc concerns). Multiple such models using different underlying architectures have been proposed, but almost all examples exclusively deal with image classification problems.Answer 3:You could use transfer learning (i.e. use a pre-trained model, then change its last layer to accommodate the new classes, and re-train this slightly modified model, maybe with a lower learning rate) to achieve that, but transfer learning does not necessarily attempt to retain any of the previously acquired information (especially if you don't use very small learning rates, you keep on training and you do not freeze the weights of the convolutional layers), but only to speed up training or when your new dataset is not big enough, by starting from a model that has already learned general features that are supposedly similar to the features needed for your specific task. There is also the related domain adaptation problem.There are more suitable approaches to perform incremental class learning (which is what you are asking for!), which directly address the catastrophic forgetting problem. For instance, you can take a look at this paper Class-incremental Learning via Deep Model Consolidation, which proposes the Deep Model Consolidation (DMC) approach. There are other continualincremental learning approaches, many of them are described here or in more detail here.Answer 4:by using Continual learning approaches to trained without losing the original classes. It has 3 categories:RegularizationExpansionRehearsalAnswer 5:if you access to the dataset then you can download it and add all you new classes when you have " 'N' COCO Classes  'M' New classes " after that you can fine tune model based on new dataset. you do not need all of the dataset just same number of image for all class enough.  Before start your machine learning project ask these questions and preparation: What is your inference hardware? specify the use case. specify model interface. how would we monitor performance after deployment? how can we approximate post-deployment monitoring before deployment? build a model and iteratively improve it.

Combining color and depth data the candidate faceregion can be extracted from the background and measures of depth and reg-ularity are used for filtering out false positives.The size criteria simply remove the candidate faces not included in a fixed rangesize (12.5,30 cm).

(and a dataset of 230,000 3D facial landmarks) we construct, for the first time, a very strong baseline by combining a state-of-the-art architecture for landmark localization with a state-of-the-art residual block, train it on a very large yet synthetically expanded 2D facial landmark dataset and fi- nally evaluate it on all other 2D facial landmark datasets. (b) We create a guided by 2D landmarks network which con- verts 2D landmark annotations to 3D and unifies all exist- ing datasets, leading to the creation of LS3D-W, the largest and most challenging 3D facial landmark dataset to date (230,000 images). (c) Following that, we train a neural network for 3D face alignment and evaluate it on the newly introduced LS3D-W. (d) We further look into the effect of all traditional factors affecting face alignment performance like large pose, initialization and resolution, and introduce a new one, namely the size of the network. (e) We show that both 2D and 3D face alignment networks achieve per- formance of remarkable accuracy which is probably close to saturating the datasets used. Training and testing code as well as the dataset can be downloaded from https: www.adrianbulat.comface-alignment 19.Sep.2021Medium  English (learn write English) storyGreek Mythology Explained: A Deeper Look at Classical Greek Lore and MythPapers:CALTag: High Precision Fiducial Markers for CameraDiatom Autofocusing in Brightfield Microscopy: a Comparative Study   :implementation variation of the laplacianAnalysis of focus measure operators in shape-from-focus: why laplacian?

The EU regulations will set a new global standard for privacy rights and change the way organizations worldwide store and process personal data. The GDPR brings the importance of preserving the privacy of personal information to the forefront, yet the importance of face images within this context is often overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a solution that helps companies protect face images in IoT devices which record or process image by camera, to strengthen compliance with the GDPR. Our Face is our Identity Our face is the most fundamental and highly visible element of our identity. People recognize us when they see our face or a photo of our face. Recent years have seen exponential increase in the use, storage and dissemination of face images in both private and public sectors - in social networks, corporate databases, IoT, smart-city deployments, digital media, government applications, and nearly every organizations databases. ---------------------(aws-okta env stage)aws s3 cp s3:datasetarchive.tar.gz Usersa.zipaws s3 ls images  tail -n 100aws s3 cp staging-imagestest.jpg Userstest.jpg---------------------screen -rDk get podsDockerRUN chmod x tmprun.shCan run docker in terminal and run code line by linedocker run -it --rm debian:stable-slim bashapt-get updateapt-get installl -y--------------------------------brew install awscli aws-okta kubectx kubernetes-cli tfenvtouch .awsconfig--------------------------------------------------------------------docker image rm TETSTDFSAFDSADFdocker image lsdocker system prunedocker run -p 5000:5000 nameDocker:latestdocker build . -t nameDocker:latestdocker container stop number-docker-namedocker container lsdocker pull quay.iotest:v0.0.1docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 -it quay.iotest:v0.0.1curl --header "Content-Type: applicationjson" --request POST --data '"fixed":7.4, "a":0, "b":0.56, "c":9.4'  run --rm -v home.awscredentials:root.awscredentials -it quay.iotest binsh aws s3 ls --profiletest--------------------------------Cloud software engineer and consultant focusing on building highly available, scalable and fully automated infrastructure environments on top of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure clouds.
