# Large Language Models in Computer Vision and Image Processing

This document provides an overview of recent papers and articles that focus on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the fields of computer vision and image processing.

## Papers and Articles

### 1. "Large Language Models Meet Computer Vision; A Brief Survey"
- **Overview**: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the significant strides made in Visual-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs), which have emerged as a powerful approach for learning joint representations of visual and linguistic content.
