/Users/farshid/farshid/pirahansiah.github.io/src/LLMs/a.jpg," The image displays a social media post featuring a QR code. The background of the post is white, and there's text at the top which appears to be in Persian (Farsi) script, although the content of the text is not clear due to its resolution.

In the foreground, centered on the image, is a smartphone with a QR code displayed on its screen. The phone has a dark background and is showing the QR code with a focus on the center. The smartphone is encased in a light brown frame that mimics the appearance of a smartphone case or stand.

In the top right corner, there's an avatar of a person, presumably the user who posted this image. Below the avatar, there's a line of text which seems to be the username or handle associated with the post. The text reads ""Farshid Piranpahl Sahal"".

The overall style of the image suggests it is a screenshot from a social media platform, likely intended for sharing information such as contact details or a webpage link, given the presence of the QR code. "
