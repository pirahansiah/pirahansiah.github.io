# Generative AI Business Intelligence Computer Vision (BI4CV)

Welcome to the BI4CV repository! This project is dedicated to revolutionizing the way businesses approach image and video dataset analysis. Our innovative Business Intelligence (BI) tools are designed to enhance storytelling and provide actionable insights for your media content.

Through advanced visualizations, interactive dashboards, and detailed reports, our system intelligently selects the optimal visual representations based on the diversity and complexity of your dataset. This approach simplifies the analytics process, making it accessible to users regardless of their technical expertise.


## Project Aim

Our aim is to develop a comprehensive suite of tools that leverage machine learning and local large language models (LLMs) to provide smart and intuitive BI dashboards for your image and video media content. These dashboards facilitate deeper insights into your datasets without requiring users to have technical experience in machine learning.

## Features

- **Advanced Visualization Tools**: Best-in-class tools for data visualization that make insights accessible and actionable.
- **Smart Dashboard Creation**: Utilize built-in ML-powered features to effortlessly create and customize BI dashboards.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically detect and alert on anomalies, outliers, exceptions, and deviations in your data.
- **Local LLM Integration**: Leverage local LLMs for enhanced data storytelling and smarter BI dashboard creation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: No prior technical knowledge of machine learning required to use the system.
